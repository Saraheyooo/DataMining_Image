ar2Grm_t8X8,COPANusa,UCFLfhwQvxrb15ZLT4jaySRw,1484689706.0,How to Collect Nasopharyngeal Samples for Flu Testing Using COPAN Flocked Swabs,"How to Collect Nasopharyngeal Samples for Flu Testing Using COPAN Flocked Swabs

This video is intended for nurses, lab technicians and other clinical staff, and provides simple step by step instructions given by Dr. Aleta Bonner of Dell Children's Hospital in Austin, TX, on using COPAN’s nasopharyngeal flocked swab (FLOQSwabs™) and Universal Transport Media (UTM™) for flu testing on patients of all ages. 
COPAN’s UTM™ and FLOQSwabs™ offer a convenient and more comfortable alternative to the nasal aspirate for flu sample collection on patients of all ages.
Specimen collection should be performed by health care personnel who have completed training and demonstrated competency.  Always read the manufacturer’s package insert for specific instruction regarding specimen collection and transport for the type of test kit being used. 

For best results, follow steps outlined in this video and briefly summarized here:

• Take the disposable ruler supplied by COPAN and place it at the child’s earlobe and measure from there to the base of the nose
 
 • Divide that number in half to determine the appropriate depth of insertion and mark on the swab using a pen or marker
• Have the patient lay back. In younger children, a parent or guardian should hold their hands and forehead to steady the head and prevent injury to both you and the child.
• Beginning at the base of the nose, hold the swab horizontally and insert until the marked depth is reached
• Remove the swab and check for mucus. Note* if no mucus is present insert the swab into the second nare and perform the steps again
• Remove the swab and place it into the transport media
• Break the swab at the red breakpoint and close the tube
• Send the sample to the lab

COPAN’s UTM™, Universal Transport Medium, is a room temperature stable viral transport medium for collection, transport, maintenance and long-term freeze storage of Viruses, such as Influenza H1N1. Using UTM™ in conjunction with a flocked swab which, unlike traditional fiber swabs, have no internal absorbent core to entrap the specimen. The entire sample elutes for superior fluid dynamics for more sensitive influenza testing.

In this video, AMBOSS presents care providers with an overview of sampling both the nasopharynx and oropharynx in suspected COVID-19 cases, an acute respiratory illness associated with infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. While a nasopharyngeal swab is the preferred testing method of the WHO and CDC, an oropharyngeal swab can also be conducted if necessary. When performing either type of swab, special care should be taken to reduce the risk of infection and ensure the reliability of swab results.

U8r3oTVMtQ0,FreeMedEducation,UCTCEJCypL-cwp2EWlT5pmGg,1587814422.0,Recognizing Day to Day Signs and Symptoms of Coronavirus,"DAY TO DAY SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 
Before proceeding, please note that this general overview is compiled for initial self-assessment only and may vary for each individual. If you're not feeling well, you should immediately consult a medical practitioner to have an accurate diagnosis and proper treatment of COVID-19.
The typical daily symptoms are concluded from the study of 138 patients at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and another study involving 135 patients from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 patients from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital.
These symptoms are broken down into:
DAY 1 TO DAY 2
The beginning symptoms are similar to the common cold with a mild sore throat and neither having a fever nor feeling tired. Patients can still consume food and drink as usual.
DAY 3
The patient's throats start to feel a bit painful. Body temperature reads at around 36.5° celsius. Although it's uncommon, other symptoms like mild nausea, vomiting or mild diarrhea are possible to set in. 
DAY 4
Throat pain becomes more serious. Other symptoms like feeling weak and joint pain start to manifest. The patient may show a temperature reading between 36.5° to 37° celsius.
DAY 5 TO 6
Mild fever starts. The patients show a temperature reading above 37.2° celsius. The second most common symptom, dry cough, also appears. Dyspnea or breathing difficulty may occur occasionally. Most patients in this stage are easily feeling tired. Other symptoms remain about the same. These four symptoms are among the top five key indications of COVID-19 according to the final report of the initial outbreak conducted by the joint mission of China and WHO.
DAY 7
The patients that haven't started recovering by day 7 get more serious coughs and breathing difficulty. Fever can get higher up to 38° celsius. Patients may develop further headache and body pain or worsening diarrhea if there’s any. Many patients are admitted to the hospital at this stage. 
DAY 8 TO 9 
On the 8th day, the symptoms are likely to be worsened for the patient who has coexisting medical conditions. Severe shortness of breath becomes more frequent. Temperature reading goes well above 38°. In one of the studies, day 9 is the average time when Sepsis starts to affect 40% of the patients.
DAY 10 TO 11
Doctors are ordering imaging tests like chest x-ray to capture the severity of respiratory distress in patients. Patients are having loss of appetite and may be facing abdominal pain. The condition also needs immediate treatment in ICU. 
DAY 12 TO 14
For the survivors, the symptoms can be well-managed at this point. Fever tends to get better and breathing difficulties may start to cease on day 13. But Some patients may still be affected by mild cough even after hospital discharge.  
DAY 15 TO 16
Day 15 is the opposite condition for the rest of the minority patients . The fragile group must prepare for the possibility of acute cardiac injury or kidney injury. 
DAY 17 TO 19
COVID-19 fatality cases happen at around day 18. Before the time, vulnerable patients may develop a secondary infection caused by a new pathogen in the lower respiratory tract. The severe condition may then lead to a blood coagulation and ischemia.
DAY 20 TO 22
The surviving patients are recovered completely from the disease and are discharged from the hospital.

TLpbfOJ4bJU,DW Documentary,UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,1583229062.0,Better brain health | DW Documentary,"Chocolate reduces stress. Fish stimulates the brain. Is there any truth to such popular beliefs? The findings of researchers around the world say yes: It appears we really are what we eat.

A study in a British prison found that inmates who took vitamin supplements were less prone to violent behavior. And in Germany, a psychologist at the University of Lübeck has shown that social behavior is influenced by the ingredients consumed at breakfast. But what really happens in the brain when we opt for honey instead of jam, and fish rather than sausage? Scientists around the world are trying to find out. Neuro-nutrition is the name of an interdisciplinary research field that investigates the impact of nutrition on brain health. Experiments on rats and flies offer new insight into the effects of our eating habits. When laboratory rats are fed a diet of junk food, the result is not just obesity. The menu also has a direct influence on their memory performance. The role of the intestinal flora has been known for some time, but scientists are currently discovering other relationships. So-called ""brain food"" for example: The Mediterranean diet that’s based on vegetables and fish is said to provide the best nutrition for small grey cells. Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, for example, protect the nerve cells and are indispensable for the development of the brain - because the brain is also what it eats!

Ninja Nerds,
What is Corona virus? What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-COV2 is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.
Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.  Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. It is believed that COVID-19 was transmitted from pangolin to humans (current theory).
Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death (WHO, 2020). 
Ninja Nerd Lectures has compiled the most up to date and recent data on COVID-19 as of March 15, 2020. Please follow along with this lecture to understand the origin and zoonosis of COVID-19, the routes of transmission, epidemiology (current as of 3/15/2020), pathophysiology, and diagnostic tests used to identify COVID-19. 
As new information and research is published we will continue to provide updates on COVID-19 and ensure all of our viewers are kept up to date on the most recent data.

This example demonstrates a sandwich (non-competitive) immunoassay format: a format that has had commercial success. Alternative formats have been utilised in lateral flow rapid tests across a number of industries.

Within the animation, you will see how the various components (labels conjugated to antibodies, capture antibodies, nitrocellulose membranes etc) interact with one another in order to produce rapid test results. 

LFIAs, which are rapid diagnostics, can be configured to work with a number of whole liquid samples, such as blood, urine or milk. Or they can work with prepared samples: a sample diluted with a buffer, for example. We use a generic sample in this animation. 

Some lateral flow tests come in a housed cassette whereas others operate as a dipstick.

Especially “Our World in Data”, the online publication for research and data on the world’s largest problems – and how to make progress solving them. Check out their site. It also includes a constantly updated page on the Corona Pandemic.

In December 2019 the Chinese authorities notified the world that a virus was spreading through their communities. In the following months it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days. This virus is the “Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2”, that causes the disease called COVID19, and that everyone simply calls Coronavirus.

What actually happens when it infects a human and what should we all do?

Main points:
1. The tobacco used in cigarettes contain over 7000 chemicals - at least 250 of these are known to be harmful to health and over 70 are known carcinogens
2. Many chemicals within tobacco are absorbed into the bloodstream. This means that the harmful effects of cigarettes are not just limited to the lung
3. Nicotine is the main chemical responsible for the positive feelings associated with smoking. Nicotine can make you feel more alert, focussed and relaxed.
4. There is hope! The number of smokers worldwide is decreasing.

ID#: ANH12071

Transcript:
Every time you smoke a cigarette, toxic gases pass into your lungs, then into your bloodstream, where they spread to every organ in your body. A cigarette is made using the tobacco leaf, which contains nicotine and a variety of other compounds. As the tobacco and compounds burn, they release thousands of dangerous chemicals, including over forty known to cause cancer. Cigarette smoke contains the poisonous gases carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide, as well as trace amounts of cancer-causing radioactive particles. All forms of tobacco are dangerous, including cigars, pipes, and smokeless tobacco, such as chewing tobacco and snuff. 

Nicotine is an addictive chemical in tobacco. Smoking causes death. People who smoke typically die at an earlier age than non-smokers. In fact, 1 of every 5 deaths in the United States is linked to cigarette smoking.

If you smoke, your risk for major health problems increases dramatically, including: heart disease, heart attack, stroke, lung cancer, and death from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Smoking causes cardiovascular disease.  

When nicotine flows through your adrenal glands, it stimulates the release of epinephrine, a hormone that raises your blood pressure. In addition, nicotine and carbon monoxide can damage the lining of the inner walls in your arteries. Fatty deposits, called plaque, can build up at these injury sites and become large enough to narrow the arteries and severely reduce blood flow, resulting in a condition called atherosclerosis. In coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis narrows the arteries that supply the heart, which reduces the supply of oxygen to your heart muscle, increasing your risk for a heart attack. Smoking also raises your risk for blood clots because it causes platelets in your blood to clump together. Smoking increases your risk for peripheral vascular disease, in which atherosclerotic plaques block the large arteries in your arms and legs. Smoking can also cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is a swelling or weakening of your aorta where it runs through your abdomen.

Smoking damages two main parts of your lungs: your airways, also called bronchial tubes, and small air sacs called alveoli. Cigarette smoke irritates the lining of your bronchial tubes, causing them to swell and make mucus. Cigarette smoke also slows the movement of your cilia, causing some of the smoke and mucus to stay in your lungs. While you are sleeping, some of the cilia recover and start pushing more pollutants and mucus out of your lungs. When you wake up, your body attempts to expel this material by coughing repeatedly, a condition known as smoker's cough. Over time, chronic bronchitis develops as your cilia stop working, your airways become clogged with scars and mucus, and breathing becomes difficult.

Your lungs are now more vulnerable to further disease. Cigarette smoke also damages your alveoli, making it harder for oxygen and carbon dioxide to exchange with your blood. Over time, so little oxygen can reach your blood that you may develop emphysema, a condition in which you must gasp for every breath and wear an oxygen tube under your nose in order to breathe.

Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are collectively called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. COPD is a gradual loss of the ability to breathe for which there is no cure. 

Cigarette smoke contains at least 40 cancer-causing substances, called carcinogens, including cyanide, formaldehyde, benzene, and ammonia. In your body, healthy cells grow, make new cells, then die. Genetic material inside each cell, called DNA, directs this process. If you smoke, toxic chemicals can damage the DNA in your healthy cells. As a result, your damaged cells create new unhealthy cells, which grow out of control and may spread to other parts of your body. Cigarettes can cause cancer in other parts of your body, such as: in the blood and bone marrow, mouth, larynx, throat, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, kidney, bladder, uterus, and cervix.

Smoking can cause infertility in both men and women. If a woman is pregnant and smokes during pregnancy, she exposes her baby to the cigarette's poisonous chemicals, causing a greater risk of: low birth weight, miscarriage, preterm delivery, stillbirth, infant death, and sudden infant death syndrome. Smoking is also dangerous if a mother is breastfeeding. Nicotine passes to the baby through breast milk, and can cause restlessness, rapid heartbeat, vomiting, interrupted sleep, or diarrhea. 

Other health effects of smoking include: low bone density and increased risk for hip fracture among women; gum disease, often leading to tooth loss and surgery; immune system dysfunction and delayed wound healing; and sexual impotence in men.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gwuwrRK-I2Y/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-10 17:06:13.350922

Download link: http://globalhealthmedia.org/videos/

This animated story is told by a young girl whose grandfather dies from Ebola and puts the rest of her family at risk. It brings to life the many messages that are so crucial in understanding this disease on a community level.
 
The film makes visible the invisible Ebola germs to help people see and understand how Ebola spreads and how to protect themselves. Critical messages are woven through the story so that people better understand Ebola, see themselves within the context of an outbreak, and see how to act in ways that can keep themselves safe from the disease and protect their communities.

This film is intended to help meet the need for better education and awareness that is critical in eradicating this disease in West Africa, and whenever and wherever potential outbreaks may threaten communities in the future.

Welcome to another video, for those of you who don’t know me, I’m Doctor Mike Hansen, I am a real doctor who specializes in pulmonary medicine, critical care medicine, and internal medicine. 

Verify my board certification status:
https://www.abim.org/verify-physician/Hansen-Michael-wGD6UJS3yo0=.aspx

When I’m not working in the hospital or pulmonary clinic, I’m at home working on making these videos for you, to deliver you accurate medical expertise, to the best of my ability (especially during this coronavirus pandemic). 

This coronavirus, we know, is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets, and through contact, by getting into our mucosa, like our mouth, nose, and eyes. Although less common, it also can be transmitted through aerosol, meaning airborne. Most likely when you have people in an enclosed space, such as an elevator, and someone sneezes or coughs without covering their mouths, and someone else can inhale it in. 

This coronavirus attaches to cells in our body by this ACE2 receptor. This ACE2 receptor is only located on certain cells in our body. It's on our tongue, in our nose, back of the throat, and in our lungs. Specifically, within the lungs, it's only located on our type II alveolar cells. 

We know that ARDS develops in about 4 to 5% of COVID patients. And of all the people who get Coronavirus, the mortality rate is around 1 to 2% or max 3%. So why do some COVID patients get ARDS, and why do some die? There are different reasons, and let's talk about them. It could be one of these reasons, but more likely it’s a combination of these reasons.

1) The coronavirus only gains entry into our cells that express the ACE2 receptor. They are located in multiple sites. Besides being in the lung, they’re in your mouth, nose, throat, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, brain, and testes.

2) It makes sense that if the virus only gets into your mouth or nose or throat, but not the lungs, that it would cause only cold-like symptoms. But if the virus gets all the way down into the alveoli of your lungs, that’s what's going to cause ARDS.  And by the way, the ACE2 receptors in your gut probably explains why some patients get nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. 

3) The amount of virus that you get into your body likely determines how sick you get. This is what we call the viral load. 

4) The inflammatory reaction that occurs with COVID is extremely complicated with lots of different proteins and hormones and interleukins at play. But there are several known genetic polymorphisms of these proteins that likely make some people more prone to getting worse illnesses than others. A genetic polymorphism simply means a variation on a particular gene. For example, there are genetic polymorphisms for the ACE gene, as well as IL-6. Basically, a lot of it just comes down to our genes. 

5) Because the 5th reason has to do with estrogen. Estrogen is known to inhibit the effects of IL-6, which plays a huge role in this cytokine storm. This might explain why women overall have less severe disease compared to men. 

6) And the 6th reason is because of people who are already taking certain medications. For those people who are already on and ACEI such as lisinopril, or an ARB such as losartan, or telmisartan, or candesartan, or irbesartan. Or people who take hydroxychloroquine for lupus or rheumatoid disease. Or people who take tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor inhibitor. Are these coronavirus patients less prone to getting severe illness? My guess is yes.

As a doctor of physical therapy, I get asked about sleeping positions all the time. Usually these questions come from patients who are dealing with pain either in their necks or lower backs.

These conditions can be limiting and debilitating on so many levels; one thing that is often affected his sleep.

Today I wanted to share with you five tips to ensure you are getting your best sleep possible even despite

1. The best sleeping position for you is one that is comfortable and holds your spine in the correct posture: The bottom line is the best sleeping position for you is which ever position you find to be the most comfortable while keeping your spine in as neutral a position as possible. Make sure you are aware of your spine alignment front to back, side to side, as well as if you are rotating or not.

2. To get the right posture you need the right support: In order to achieve a correct, neutral spine posture, you need to have the right support from your mattress and from your pillow.

Mattress: It is recommended that you replace your mattress every 8-10 years. If patients come to me who wake up with pain/stiffness in their spine often they’re sleeping on an older mattress. If it’s been a decade since you got a new mattress it might be time.

Pillow: I make pillow recommendations based solely on two things - body type and sleeping posture. I would recommend a different pillow for someone with a petite frame versus a larger frame. Similarly, it you slept primarily on your back my recommendation would be different than if you slept primarily on your side.

3. Stomach Sleep: DON’T DO IT! This is the worst of all the postures you can sleep in through the night. It maximally rotates your neck all night, it puts your lower back in an extended position, and it puts pressure on your internal organs. Stop sleeping on your stomach.

4. Side Sleepers: Again the goal is to achieve as close to neutral spine as possible. This is achieved with proper support for your head/neck, torso, and hips/legs.

Head and neck: you want a pillow that supports your neck in a neutral position. If your pillow is too full your neck will be bent too much up towards the ceiling. If your pillow is too flat your head will be bent too much down towards your bed. Try to find the right pillow to achieve a neutral spine position.

Torso: Again, this is where the right mattress comes into play. It needs to be firm enough to support the side of your trunk but soft enough to unload your shoulders and hips (areas of higher pressure). You can also get small pillows designed specifically to achieve this goal. Click here to see these pillows:

Hips: Oftentimes when we sleep on our sides our top leg rests on top of our bottom leg putting pressure on your knees, pulling on your hips, and pulling your spine out of alignment. My solution here is to sleep with a pillow between your knees to unload stress at all three of these areas. You can even get pillows that specifically go between your legs that are intended for side sleepers; check out this link to get yours:

5. Back sleepers: Back sleepers are typically a little more prone to snoring, but if you can handle that it’s a really good position for your back! Again, the whole goal here will be getting your spine into a correct position and supporting it there.

Head and neck: Again - you want just the right amount of support to maintain your head/neck at the correct angle. If your pillow is too full, you’ll spend all night with your neck flexed up. If your pillow is too flat, you’ll spend all night with your head extended and your neck unsupported. Typically your pillow should be smaller if you sleep on your back than it would be if you preferred to sleep on your side.

Hips: Oftentimes laying out flat on our backs puts a lot of stress on our lower back due to hip flexors pulling on our spine. I always recommend that if you sleep on your back you do so with 1-2 pillows under your knees to unload some pressure in your spine. You can also buy different wedge-shaped pillows designed specifically for this purpose.

Ethanol: this molecule, made of little more than a few carbon atoms, is responsible for drunkenness. Often simply referred to as alcohol, ethanol is the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages. So how exactly does it cause drunkenness, and why does it have dramatically different effects on different people? Judy Grisel explores alcohol's journey through the body.

DEEP LOOK is an ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small. 

Head lice can only move by crawling on hair. They glue their eggs to individual strands, nice and close to the scalp, where the heat helps them hatch. They feed on blood several times a day. And even though head lice can spread by laying their eggs in sports helmets and baseball caps, the main way they get around is by simply crawling from one head to another using scythe-shaped claws.  

These claws, which are big relative to a louse’s body, work in unison with a small spiky thumb-like part called a spine. With the claw and spine at the end of each of its six legs, a louse grasps a hair strand to hold on, or quickly crawl from hair to hair like a speedy acrobat.

Their drive to stay on a human head is strong because once they’re off and lose access to their blood meals, they starve and die within 15 to 24 hours.

--- How do you kill lice?
Researchers found in 2016 that lice in the U.S. have become resistant to over-the-counter insecticide shampoos, which contain natural insecticides called pyrethrins, and their synthetic version, known as pyrethroids.  

Other products do still work against lice, though. Prescription treatments that contain the insecticides ivermectin and spinosad are effective, said entomologist John Clark, of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. They’re prescribed to kill both lice and their eggs. Clark said treatments such as suffocants, which block the lice’s breathing holes, and hot-air devices that dry them up, also work. He added that tea tree oil works both as a repellent and a “pretty good” insecticide. Combing lice and eggs out with a special metal comb is also a recommended treatment.

--- How long do lice survive?
It takes six to nine days for their eggs to hatch and about as long for the young lice to grow up and start laying their own eggs. Adult lice can live on a person’s head for up to 30 days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

--- Can your pet give you lice?
No. Human head lice only live on our heads. They can’t really move to other parts of our body or onto pets.

We're gonna start with the mouth because it's the gateway to the digestive system. That system is designed specifically to transform food into useful nutrients that keep you energized and help your cells grow and repair. 

By the way, did you know that the amount of saliva you produce in a year could fill 2 medium-sized bathtubs!  Almost a pool full of drool! Yuck! But saliva comes in handy as it mixes with food and breaks it down even more. That way, your stomach doesn’t have to digest whole chunks of food. Interested? Then let's do it! You're gonna learn a lot about yourself!

SUMMARY:
- So, once you grab the first bite of whatever you’re eating, you turn on the digestion machine. As you chew, food is broken up into pieces to make the process easier.
- The muscles in the walls of this guy’s esophagus are squeezing behind me and relaxing in front of me. This is a process called peristalsis, and it’s what moves me through your digestive system. 
- The stomach holds, mixes, and grinds the food up into mush, so it has to be pretty strong.
- The small intestine is made up of 3 sections. Bile is crucial to digest fat and take all the waste out of your blood, so be thankful your liver produces it.
- And that thing over there that looks like a pear – that’s the gallbladder. It’s located under the liver and keeps bile in it until the right moment comes. 
- Also known as the colon, it’s a muscular tube that’s 5 to 6 feet long. 
- Your intestines need good bacteria to help them break down food, vitamins, and nutrients so that your body can use them. 
- Still loads of bacteria all over the place. There can’t be too little or too many – otherwise you’d have digestive problems like food intolerances. 
- When the left colon gets too full of stool, it decides to dump it all into the rectum because it can't hold it all by itself. 
- The rectum is a straight chamber that’s about 8 inches long. It has special sensors, like this one or that one there, that let you know when there’s something you should get rid of.
- If the moment is right for you (that is, you find a toilet), the sphincters relax, and ta-da! Your stool makes its exit. 
- Those rectum sensors help too so that the urge to release its contents disappears for a while.

Transcript:

What is biomimicry? Bio means life; mimicry means imitate. So biomimicry is the practice of imitating life. biomimicry looks to Nature to provide inspiration and direction to sustainably solve our most pressing challenges; it's innovation inspired by nature. 
Human beings are clever. We've created cities, economies, and whole societies… but at the same time and without meaning to, we've also created massive sustainability challenges for future generations and ourselves. Biomimicry is a way to address these problems by creating policies, products and processes that are adapted to life on earth. The idea goes like this:

Plants, animals and microbes are amazing. They have spent billions of years engineering and testing ways to thrive on the planet. 3.8 billion years, to be precise. That's a lot of research and development! After all this R&D, what didn't work doesn't exist anymore, and what surrounds us has learned to survive. Solutions to challenges large and small are all around us – we just need to look. Here are two examples.

Sustainable energy provision is a massive sustainability challenge. The race is on to find economically viable sustainable energy solutions. Biomimicry asks, ""What could we learn from Nature that could help us produce sustainable energy, or make more efficient the current alternative technologies that are already out there?""
Seemingly large and unwieldy, humpback whales display surprising agility in the water. This is due mainly to their flippers, which have large, irregular bumps called tubercles across their leading edges.  Inspired by these flippers, a company called WhalePower has developed turbine blades – with bumps called tubercles on the leading edge. These blades promise greater efficiency in many applications, from wind turbines to hydroelectric turbines, to irrigation pumps to ventilation fans.  In fact, using these blades to catch wind could provide up to 20% increased efficiency, making this type of alternative energy competitive with other energy sources. Thank you, humpback whales! Here's another example of biomimicry in action. 

The Shinkansen bullet train is one of the fastest trains in the world. Offering high-speed travel between several of Japan's metropolitan areas, it used to travel over 200 miles per hour. But, every time the train emerged from a tunnel air pressure changes made a sonic boom, like a large thunderclap, causing people one-quarter mile away who lived along the train line to complain. Japan has strict noise pollution laws, so this had to be solved. The train's chief engineer was a dedicated bird-watcher. He asked himself, ""Is there something in Nature that travels quickly and smoothly between two different mediums?"" The kingfisher dives from the air into water to catch fish and produces almost no splash at all compared to similar sized-birds or animals. Modelling the front end of the train after the beak of kingfishers resulted in a quieter train, one that uses 15% less electricity while travelling 10% faster. By emulating Nature, the bullet train designers were able to able to solve an important problem. 

Imagine what other problems might be solved by turning to the world around us and asking, ""What would Nature do?""",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UHb_XNgIHFY/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-10 17:06:16.565818

💥 Herbs to Clear Your Lungs (Guide) ➜ ➜ ➜ https://bit.ly/3llMfL9

🟦 1. Eucalyptus
Eucalyptus has a component called cineole which is an active ingredient that works as an expectorant. This means that it can ease a cough and aid in the removal of secretions. Cineole has antioxidant and antimicrobial effects that can provide a boost to your immune system as well. It reacts with the mucous membranes of the lungs and helps loosen up secretions so that they can be coughed up more easily.

🟦 2. Horehound
The horehound leaf, which comes from the mint family, is actually a common ingredient in cough drops and cough syrup. That is because, its natural properties work as an expectorant to aid in the removal of mucus and secretions from the lungs. This means that it would be useful for those with allergies, sinus infections, and chest congestion. 

🟦 3. Osha Root
The roots of this herb contain several components that can provide a boost to your lungs and respiratory system. Specifically, it helps increase blood circulation to your lungs which, in turn, helps improve oxygenation throughout the entire body. Osha root also has antihistamine properties which works well for soothing sinus infections and other respiratory illnesses. Examples include: cough, sore throat, bronchitis, and common colds. A few drops of concentrated osha root extract can be added to your water or beverage of choice. The numbing effects help to alleviate the irritated tissues of your airways and respiratory tract. 

🟦 4. Ginseng
It's an herb that has been used in traditional Asian medicine for centuries. Ginseng is known for its potent antioxidant properties which works well for fighting inflammation. Not only is this beneficial for your lungs, it's good for pretty much every organ and system in the human body. Not to mention, studies found that ginseng actually can provide a boost to your immune system as well.

That's not even why we included ginseng in this video. The reason is, studies found that ginseng is beneficial for those with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). And in case you weren't aware, COPD is the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States, so it affects far more people than you probably realize. 

🟦 5. Mullein
It's another herb that has traditionally been used as a remedy for the lungs and respiratory tract thanks to its soothing ingredients. The mullein leaf has antibacterial properties that fight against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Some studies found that it even has antiviral and antifungal properties as well. This trifecta is good when it comes to treating breathing issues that are associated with colds and respiratory infections.

The sun. Smooth and round and peaceful. Except when it suddenly vomits radiation and plasma in random directions. These solar flares and coronal mass ejections, or CMEs can hit earth and have serious consequences for humanity. 

How exactly do they work, how bad could they be and can we prepare for them?

The desire to be free from the limits of the human experience is as old as our first stories. We exist in an endless universe, only bound by the laws of physics and yet, our consciousness is trapped in mortal machines made of meat. With the breathtaking explosion of innovation and progress, for the first time the concept of leaving our flesh piles behind and uploading our minds into a digital utopia seems possible. Even like the logical next step on our evolutionary ladder.

This documentary looks at what superfoods do for people and more. How is the healthy eating boom influencing agriculture and business? There are more and more restaurants serving superfoods in Germany. Florian Klar of Bochum opened the first superfood bistro in the Ruhr region about a year ago. He buys in all types of food, using local suppliers when he can, but he also uses exotic superfoods in his meals. 

Quinoa, goji berries and chia seeds can now all be found in supermarkets as well. The food industry has discovered selling these products is lucrative and changed its product selection accordingly. Superfoods are simply that a foodstuff contains a high amount of nutrients. ""Every country has its own superfood,” says nutritionist Matthias Riedl. Blueberries, flax seed, blackcurrants, and kale are all superfoods native to Germany. 

The film also takes viewers to Bolivia, a key quinoa exporter, to see how the hype has influenced farming there. Exports of the so-called ""Inca corn” quadrupled between 2007 and 2013. The rising price of quinoa on global markets has led Andean farmers to increase the size of their fields. Yet after just two straight years of quinoa harvests, the soil is already exhausted and barren.

CVuVlk2E_e4,DW Documentary,UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,1497960530.0,"Money, happiness and eternal life - Greed (director's cut) | DW Documentary","Can money and power ever make us happy? How much is enough? Our constant desire for more is part of our human nature.

Some call it a useful dowry of evolution, others a fault in the human genetic make-up: The old mortal sin Greed seems to be more ubiquitous than ever. Why can't people ever get enough, where is this self-indulgence leading - and are there any ways out of this vicious circle of gratification?

""People like to have a lot of stuff because it makes them the feeling of living forever,"" says American social psychologist Sheldon Solomon, who believes today's materialism and consumerism will have disastrous consequences.

Anyone who fails to satisfy his or her desires in this age of the Ego is deemed a loser. But with more than 7 billion people on the Earth, the ramifications of this excessive consumption of resources are already clear. Isn’t the deplorable state of our planet proof enough that ""The Greed Program,"" which has made us crave possessions, status and power, is coming to an end? Or is the frenzied search for more and more still an indispensable part of our nature? We set off to look for the essence of greed. And we tell the stories of people who - whether as perpetrators or victims or even just as willing consumers - have become accomplices in a sea change in values.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d0yGdNEWdn0/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-10 17:06:19.755393

Over 40 million people in the United States live below the poverty line, twice as many as it was fifty years ago. It can happen very quickly.


Many people in the United States fall through the social safety net. In the structurally weak mining region of the Appalachians, it has become almost normal for people to go shopping with food stamps. And those who lose their home often have no choice but to live in a car. There are so many homeless people in Los Angeles that relief organizations have started to build small wooden huts to provide them with a roof over their heads. The number of homeless children has also risen dramatically, reaching 1.5 million, three times more than during the Great Depression the 1930s. A documentary about the fate of the poor in the United States today.

We closed the commentary section because of too many inapproriate comments.

e5F1v_osAV0,DW Documentary,UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,1593159618.0,Who is Mona Lisa? | DW Documentary,"Leonardo da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"" is probably the world’s most famous painting. But whose portrait actually is it? There are two clues to the identity of the mysterious young woman, but they are mutually exclusive. Can the riddle ever be solved?

Every year, millions of visitors view the portrait exhibited in the legendary Louvre in Paris. But what makes the ""Mona Lisa"" so special? Who is hidden behind this smiling and yet sad face? Who was Leonardo's model? Or is she even the imaginary image of an ideal beauty? Experts have been wrestling with this question for centuries. There seems to be evidence for two explanations. Both variants have been handed down in writing, but they are not compatible.

The most recognized theory goes back to the biographer Giorgio Vasari. According to him, the portrait is of Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of a Florentine silk merchant who had commissioned the work from Leonardo in 1503. But this is contradicted by a note of the chronicler Antonio de Beatis dating back to 1517, in which da Vinci states that he produced the painting at the request of Giuliano de' Medici. The artist said it was an imaginary representation de' Medici's mistress Pacifica Brandani, with whom de’Medici had an illegitimate son. Within the community researching Leonardo today, both theories have their supporters. Using elaborate reconstructions, original locations and scientific methodology, this documentary delves deep into the time of Leonardo da Vinci.

YRfwZcLeOm4,Ninja Nerd Lectures,UC6QYFutt9cluQ3uSM963_KQ,1587303012.0,"COVID-19 | Coronavirus: Epidemiology, Pathophysiology | APRIL UPDATE","Ninja Nerds,
Join us for our lecture on COVID-19 where Ninja Nerd Science will go into detail on the virology, epidemiology, and pathophysiology/pathology of COVID-19. This is our April update on our previous lecture to keep all of our viewers informed on the new research and publications that have been released on COVID-19. Please be aware— This lecture is up to date as of April 17, 2020. 

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-COV2 is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.
Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.  Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. It is believed that COVID-19 was transmitted from pangolin to humans (current theory).
Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death (WHO). 
Ninja Nerd Lectures has compiled the most up to date and recent data on COVID-19 as of March 15, 2020. Please follow along with this lecture to understand the treatment, prognosis, and precautions for COVID-19 (current as of 3/15/2020).

35Idb_lCU4o,Ninja Nerd Lectures,UC6QYFutt9cluQ3uSM963_KQ,1607301268.0,COVID-19 Vaccines: MODERNA | PFIZER/BIONTECH | ASTRAZENECA,"#COVID19 #coronavirus #vaccines 

During this lecture we will be discussing COVID-19 vaccines including Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, and Astrazeneca/Oxford. 

We are NOT sponsored and/or endorsed by Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, or Astrazeneca. We are presenting on RESEARCH and in no way is any of the information provided our own view or opinions. 

This will be a lecture packed with the process vaccine developers must go through; which includes a preclinical phase and phases I-III. Including information about OPERATION WARP SPEED and how this has expedited the normally lengthy vaccine process. 

We will then discuss how Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, and Astrazeneca vaccines work in the human body, preventing the SARS-CoV-2 virus and hopefully, ending this global pandemic. 

Finally-- Zach presents on all of the most current data that each of the vaccine companies have released outlining the vaccine procedure and how it will be administered, the vaccine efficacy (as a percentage), optimal storage temperature of the vaccine in order to remain viable, and the number of vaccine units these companies are capable of producing. 

IMPORTANT INFO (MUST READ):
One thing to emphasize that wasn’t harped on enough from this lecture is when these vaccines lead to an immunogenic reaction as we described above, which leads to formation of Memory B cells and Memory T cells. This is important because if we are exposed to the virus those memory cells are now primed and able to recognize and mount a powerful immune response against the virus. 

LASTLY, one additional point and clarification is when those cytotoxic T cells produce destructive molecules that damage host cells it’s important to realize that those are memory cytotoxic T cells primed by the Vaccine that damage host cells that ARE INFECTED with the SARS-COV-2 virus, NOT CELLS processing the vaccine. 

Big Takeaway:
1. Vaccine stimulates antibody production to protect against virus IF INFECTED.
2. Vaccine stimulates development of memory T and B cells to protect against virus IF INFECTED.

5BjFAJHW-bE,Thermo Fisher Scientific,UCfUs2fCDhx07fkszsJ0jOcA,1347291597.0,Baselines in Real-Time PCR -- Ask TaqMan®: Ep. 5,"Submit your Real-Time PCR questions and watch the rest of our videos at http://ow.ly/bQh0l. Life Technologies Sr. Field Application Specialist Doug Rains helps with the understanding of baselines in Real-Time PCR. We're looking at a fairly standard real-time amplification plot. We have some nice curves, each of which has the familiar geometric phase, linear phase, and plateau phase. So far, so good. But what's all this . . . junk in the early cycles? Well, friends, if you said ""junk,"" you were right. That's right, I said it -- junk, trash, waste, detritus, garbage, otherwise known as noise.
It's the stuff we see before our actual signal from amplification gets high enough to overcome that noise. And, as the rather impolite adjectives I used a second ago would suggest, it's completely useless to us. This noise does have an effect on our curves. Our job is to minimize that effect by effectively subtracting out the noise. We do that by establishing what's known as a baseline -- a cycle-to-cycle range over which only noise can be seen, prior to the appearance of curves. Once established, the software will effectively subtract out the noise on a well-by-well basis, greatly improving the quality of our data.
Let's switch the Y-axis to linear scale for a moment to illustrate the effect of baseline subtraction. Here's our data prior to baselining. Note how every sample begins from a slightly different spot on the Y-axis, causing our geometric phase data— this curvy part over here when we're in a linear scale— to look horrible. But once we subtract noise, every sample begins from the same point 0. And as a result, the data clean up nicely.
The value we get after normalizing for background noise is something called delta-Rn. If you ever look closely at a log-scale amplification curve— the one we're used to seeing— you'll notice that delta-Rn is what's graphed on the Y-axis.
But before you go, just note that there are two ways to set baselines in Applied Biosystems® real-time PCR software: manually, and automatically. If you do it the manual way, you set the baseline range under Analysis Settings. You either set it for a single assay, in which case all wells for that assay get the same subtraction . . . or you can go under Advanced Settings and set wells individually. 
Better yet, just use the default setting of Auto Baselining. With this selected, the software figures out how much noise needs to be subtracted from each well individually, and, as such, generally produces the best results.
So why have a manual feature? Well, Auto does fail on occasion, especially with some SYBR® Assays and non-standard chemistries. You'll know auto has malfunctioned by the shapes of your curves. If they look more S-shaped than they should, it could be that auto has misapplied the baseline and set the End cycle too low. As a result, not enough noise is being subtracted, and the curves take on a strange shape. To fix the problem, switch over to manual mode for that assay and raise the End cycle until the curves take on a regular shape.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5BjFAJHW-bE/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-10 17:06:21.759381

This Biotechnology Explorer™ webinar presents an overview of what real-time PCR is, what it is used for, and how it works. Also known as quantitative PCR (qPCR), this technique exploits the power of exponential DNA amplification by the polymerase chain reaction coupled with fluorescent detection of the products in real time, enabling researchers to detect and measure the initial number of copies of a target DNA sequence with high sensitivity and accuracy.

Dr David Palmer, a Bay Area biotech entrepreneur and adjunct professor at Contra Costa College, explains the principles of qPCR with examples suitable for classroom instruction. Dr Palmer discusses the usefulness of this technology, citing real-world applications: measuring the expression of a cancer-related gene, determining the viral load in HIV infection, detecting GMO DNA in food, and identifying suspects at a crime scene from a single drop of blood. He shares his classroom teaching experience, relating a unique way to illustrate the calculation of starting DNA quantities from the curves of fluorescence intensity versus time.

UrcDLopNPV8,DW Documentary,UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,1598966037.0,How coronavirus is changing the world | DW Documentary,"How are democracies and authoritarian states reacting to the coronavirus pandemic? An investigative team is looking for clues worldwide and interviewing virologists, health experts and citizens. Where is the fight against COVID-19 working and where isn’t it?

Nine months after the new coronavirus first appeared, the documentary ""The Pandemic Spreads"" finds some initial answers to these questions. The film takes the viewer on a journey around the world: We dive into seven different countries and analyze their ways of handling the virus. We return to the putative beginnings of the pandemic in Wuhan in China. We see how Taiwan reacted to the virus earlier and more decisively than almost any other country in the world, as Europe and North America were still lulling themselves into a false sense of security. In retrospect, it is clear that the Western democracies saw the coronavirus as a local Chinese problem for far too long. Yet research from France and other European countries suggest it was probably already among us here in Europe at the end of 2019. Our viral world tour also takes us to the outsiders of the pandemic: Sweden, for example. At first the Swedes' special approach was still seen as daring, but months later it seems to have gone disastrously wrong.The biggest health and economic crisis in recent history has underlined recent global political developments: as the world power USA sinks into corona chaos, its rival China seems to have hit its stride. Will Beijing’s authoritarian regime come out on top of the crisis through its aggressive and consistent approach to the virus? ""The Pandemic Spreads"" shows how COVID-19 is changing our world for good.

00:04 Specimen collection should be performed by health care personnel who have completed training and demonstrated competency. Always read the manufacturer’s instructions for specific instructions regarding specimen collection and transport for the type of test kit being used.

00:20 (Text on screen with a voice over) Personal protective equipment (PPE), including a lab coat, mask (surgical, dental, medical procedure, isolation or laser mask), eye protection and gloves should be worn at all times when collecting a respiratory specimen.

00:36 Check for nasal obstructions

00:42 Open swab package

00:46 Gently insert the swab into the nostril. Keep the swab near the septum floor of the nose while gently pushing the swab into the post nasopharynx.

00:55 As a visual reference, the swab should be inserted about half the distance from the opening of the patient’s nostril and the ear.

1:03 Rotate the swab several times

1:06 Gently remove the swab and perform the test according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

kSpggqOLgaU,COPANusa,UCFLfhwQvxrb15ZLT4jaySRw,1346327816.0,"How to Collect Nasopharyngeal Samples for Flu Testing (Dr. Bonner, Part 1 of 2)","This video is intended for nurses, lab technicians and other clinical staff. The following video features Dr. Aleta Bonner of Dell children's Hospital in Austin, TX discussing the differences between two COPAN flocked swabs, useful for nasopharyngeal collection. She demonstrates simple step by step instructions on how to properly collect nasopharyngeal samples for flu testing, first on a model, and then a child, in order to maximize patient comfort. COPAN’s mini tipped flocked swab and flexible mini tipped flocked swab both offer a convenient and more comfortable alternative to the nasal aspirate for flu sample collection on patients of all ages.

Specimen collection should be performed by health care personnel who have completed training and demonstrated competency.  Always read the manufacturer’s package insert for specific instruction regarding specimen collection and transport for the type of test kit being used. 

For best results, follow steps outlined in this video and briefly summarized here:

• Using a disposable ruler, measure the length from the base of the earlobe to the base of the nose 
• Divide that number in half to determine the appropriate depth of insertion and mark on the swab using a pen or marker
• Have the patient lay back. In younger children, a parent or guardian should hold their hands and forehead to steady the head and prevent injury
• Beginning at the base of the nose, hold the swab horizontally and insert until the marked depth is reached
• Remove the swab and check for mucus. Note* if no mucus is present insert the swab into the second nare and perform the steps again
• Remove the swab and place it into the transport media
• Break the swab at the red breakpoint and close the tube
• Send the sample to the lab

Using UTM™ in conjunction with a flocked swab which, unlike traditional fiber swabs, have no internal absorbent core to entrap the specimen offers more patient comfort. The entire sample elutes for superior fluid dynamics for more sensitive influenza testing and is a less invasive alternative to the nasal aspirate.

To purchase FLOQSwabs™ visit: http://www.copanusa.com/products/collection-transport/floqswabs-flocked-swabs/",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kSpggqOLgaU/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-10 17:06:39.459179
PV050lUShjo,COPANusa,UCFLfhwQvxrb15ZLT4jaySRw,1486665523.0,How to Use COPAN's Flocked Swabs (FLOQSwabs™) and UTM™ for Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection,"This video is intended for nurses, lab technicians and other clinical staff, and provides simple step-by-step instructions for using Copan's flocked swabs (FLOQSwabs™) and UTM for nasopharyngeal sample collection.  

For respiratory virus detection, the nasopharynx is the preferred sample site and a flocked swab with a small tip and flexible shaft, or nasal aspirate is the means for collection.

Scientific studies show that flocked swabs are equivalent in efficacy to the more invasive nasal aspirate.  The velvet brush texture of a flocked swab helps to dislodge infected cells, and the perpendicular arrangement of the fibers absorb sample by capillarity.    

Specimen collection should be performed by health care personnel who have completed training and demonstrated competency.  Always read the manufacturer’s package insert for specific instruction regarding specimen collection and transport for the type of test kit being used. 

For best results, follow steps outlined in this video and briefly summarized here:
• Check for nasal obstructions that may interfere with sampling 
• With the patient’s head tilted slightly back, gently insert the swab into the nostril keeping the swab near the septum floor of the nose while gently pushing the swab into the post-nasopharynx.  
• As a visual reference, the swab should be inserted about half the distance from the patient’s nostril and the ear.  
• Remove the cap from the tube and insert the swab into the transport container all the way to the bottom of the tube 
• Holding the tube away from your face, grasp the swab shaft above the pre-molded breakpoint and break the swab shaft at the breakpoint
• Screw the cap on tightly to prevent leakage
• Label and send specimen to testing lab following your SOP’s

FLOQSwabs™ immediately release sample into liquid media.  Since there is no inner core to trap sample, recovery is dramatically improved over traditional fiber wound swabs.

The unique ergonomic and anatomic design improves patient comfort and specimen collection.

In order for a virus like the coronavirus to be detected by a PCR, scientists need to convert the RNA to DNA. This is a process called ‘reverse transcription’. If you remember the process of copying of DNA to RNA was known as transcritption, hence the process of using rna to form dna is known as revese transcritption.
Hence using this technique of reverse transcription with the technique of Polymerase chain reaction is known as RT-PCR.
An enzyme is used by the scientists which converts the RNA into DNA and the PCR makes millions of copies of this viral DNA in no time. And subsequently scientists have a large enough quantity of viral DNA to accurately confirm that the virus is present in the sample or not.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iiXisgizkxs/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-10 17:06:40.020791

About Video :- 
This is a social science video that answers - What is earthquake? - How does earthquake occur? - What are the different types of waves? An unexpected movement of the Earth's surface is called an earthquake. When two parts of the earth's surface move suddenly in relation to each other along a fault line, due to tectonic forces, an earthquake occurs. A tremendous amount of energy is released in the form of tremors and vibrations, such earthquakes are called 'Tectonic Earthquakes'. The point of origin of an earthquake is called the 'focus', while the point directly above it, on the surface of the earth is called the 'epicentre'. Owing to the strong vibrations around the point of origin, the degree of destruction is greater around the epicentre. The branch of knowledge that deals with the study of earthquakes is called Seismology, and the experts who study seismic waves are called Seismologists. There are three types of Seismic waves that spread in all directions from the focus. They are the P. S, and L waves. The compressional waves are the first to reach the earthquake recording station as they travel 1.7 times faster than the shear waves and are therefore called 'P' (Primary) waves, while the shear waves are called 'S' (Secondary) waves. The primary waves cause the particles of rock to vibrate forwards and backwards in the direction of the waves. Secondary waves, on the other hand cause the particles to oscillate at right angles to the direction of the waves. When P and S reach the surface of the earth, they get converted into 'L' long waves that travel along the surface, vibrating horizontally at right angles to the direction of the waves called 'Love waves' or Rayleigh waves as they also travel like sea waves. The most violent shocks and subsequent destruction is caused by the L waves.

ktFDN5cBFgw,Cafe Weltschmerz,UClK9f1anqhuSaqDN5YE-wfw,1597329759.0,PCR test is verre van klinische diagnose! Flavio Pasquino en Mario Ortiz,"Diederik Gommers herkent kritiek op gebruik PCR test: Flavio Pasquino en Mario Ortiz
https://www.cafeweltschmerz.nl/diederik-gommers-is-het-eens-de-covid-19-pcr-test-zegt-niets/

Prof. dr. Diederik Gommers stuurde een bericht aan biochemicus drs. Mario Ortiz Buijsse via LinkedIn. In dat bericht gaf hij aan, het eens te zijn met hem, dat de PCR test waarmee we Covid-19 testen bij mensen, niets zegt over de klinische implicaties en het eventuele ziekteverloop. Sterker nog, volgens biochemicus Ortiz, is het veelal een klein stukje schroot en een - niet actief en in minuscul kleine getalen aanwezig - dood virusdeelje. Programmamaker, Flavio Pasquino interviewde deskundige Ortiz, over de waarde en betekenis van de PRC test methode en de rampzalige gevolgen ervan. Ze spraken over het bericht van prof. dr. Diederik Gommers en de ontwijkende antwoorden van prof. dr. Jaap van Dissel tijdens de technische briefing. Tevens analyseerden ze de technische briefing van de NOS op 11 aug jl. waar kamerleden vragen konden stellen aan het RIVM en de GGD. In de video refereert Flavio Pasquino naar een brief die Ortiz heeft verzonden aan alle kamerleden. De brief wordt in de uitzending slechts ten deel behandeld maar de integrale versie staat onder deze tekst.

De brief van Drs. Mario Ortiz Martinez:

*Foute interpretatie van positieve PCR uitslagen – Onterechte & foutieve ""besmettingen"" zorgt voor grove beleidsfouten*

Geachte Kamerleden,

U heeft het giga druk, dus ik val maar met de deur in huis met zeer belangrijke informatie, welke ik in het landsbelang acht, en waar u direct wat aan heeft:

Relevante introductie kort:
Ik ben moleculair geneticus, en ben dat vanuit de biochemie geworden aan de Rijksuniversiteit Leiden. Tevens inmiddels ook meer dan 20 jaar werkzaam in de farmaceutische & medische industrie.

Foute interpretatie van positieve PCR uitslagen – Onterechte & foutieve klinische extrapolatie zorgt voor grove beleidsfout.  
Ik heb zelf ruime ervaring met PCR, omdat dit in mijn universitaire vorming zat als biochemicus/moleculaire genetica hoofdvak. Dus ik weet goed hoe de vork in de steel zit.

Even los van de vraag, of de aan u gerapporteerde positieve PCR test aantallen nou procentueel erg weinig voorstellen, en er in relatieve zin eigenlijk weinig aan de hand is, is er iets veel wezenlijkers, wat u echt moet weten:
De GGD’s presenteren u een ‘toename’ in absolute cijfers van positieve PCR test uitslagen. (helaas niet procentueel...).
Een positieve PCR uitslag toont louter en alleen aan, of er bij iemand (een stukje) viraal RNA in neus slijmvies zat….

Cruciaal:
Iemand bij wie de test positief is, BETEKENT NIET, dat die persoon ook daadwerkelijk klinisch is geïnfecteerd, ziek is, of ziek gaat worden. Dat kan een PCR uitslag helemaal niet aantonen. Daar is deze moleculair biologische assay niet voor. Daar heb je namelijk extra klinische parameters voor nodig, want de PCR detecteert niet eens, of er intact virus RNA aanwezig was in de persoon, noch kun je iets zeggen of het virus infectieus is, of is geweest.

Ik maak mij ernstig zorgen, omdat u momenteel mogelijk (door toedoen van de media) onterecht de indruk heeft, dat het aantal potentieel zieke mensen met corona zal gaan toenemen, maar dat is dus niet correct!  
U, of een van uw medewerkers, kan mij contacten voor verdere toelichting hierover. Maar u kunt dit eigenlijk aan elke klinisch biochemicus vragen.


Zelf de Proef op de som nemen:
U kunt dit ook heel makkelijk zelf verifiëren. De GGD verzamelt al weken/maanden, al data van wie positief getest is (+ BCO). En aangezien de incubatie tijd van het virus zo ongeveer 1 week is (max 12 dagen), kunt u zowel retrospectief, alsook prospectief zo zien, of er allemaal extra zieken bij zijn gekomen, resp. bij zullen komen binnen ca. 1 week. Dat is niet het geval. En ik voorspel u, dat dit ook niet zal gebeuren. Een klein deel van echte corona zieken komt soms ook in ziekenhuis terecht, maar zoals u gezien heeft zitten ook de ziekenhuis opnames de afgelopen maanden op een nullijn. Dus u kunt eigenlijk al zien dat daar niets additiefs gebeurd is, of gebeurt. Dus hier aan kunt u al zien, dat die positieve PCR uitslagen nergens toe leiden.

U stuurt nu uw beleid en maatregelen op basis van angst voor extra “besmettingen”, maar voornoemde term is dus een zeer misleidende term voor de positieve PCR test uitslagen, die niets meer betekent, dan wat (vermoedelijk oudere) RNA fragmentjes van het virusgenoom, of soms zelfs een ander verwant virus. Het gaat daarbij ook nog eens om hooguit amper 1–2 % van alle geteste personen. Helaas blijft de media de term “besmettingen” maar gebruiken, maar zij realiseren zich niet wat de implicaties hiervan zijn, en weten zij niet eens wat PCR inhoudt. Ik wel. En vele vakgenoten met mij ook. 

Met vriendelijke groeten,

Drs. Mario Ortiz Buijsse, biochemicus (moleculaire genetica), Medical Advisor Farma.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ktFDN5cBFgw/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-10 17:06:46.821314

nJab7hcBjuE,Cafe Weltschmerz,UClK9f1anqhuSaqDN5YE-wfw,1606852282.0,"Mysterieuze, kunstzinnige protestmars in Nederland | Guerilla Mask Force","In meer dan 14 verschillende steden in ons land vond er vandaag tegelijkertijd een mysterieuze, kunstzinnige protestmars plaats. 

Enschede, Sneek, Maastricht, Zwolle, Spijkenisse, Den Haag, Amsterdam, Nijverdal, Tilburg en nog een aantal steden werden tijdens het drukke Black Friday weekend verrast door een White Performance. 

De deelnemers waren gekleed in witte pakken met witte maskers. 
Om het bovenarm een zwarte rouwband met een wit kruis erop. 
Een ludieke protestactie tegen de disproportionele corona maatregelen. 

Op de beat van voetstappen werden deze ‘slaven’ door speakers begeleid waaruit een vrouwelijke robotstem schalde die teksten uitsprak als:

‘Zelf nadenken brengt het algemeen welzijn in gevaar’
‘Mondkapjesplicht een leven lang’
‘Vaccinatie tegenstanders hun rechten ontnemen’
‘Lichaamscontact veroorzaakt leed’
‘Alleen eenzaamheid is veilig’
‘Wees altijd gehoorzaam’
‘Vaccinatie is naastenliefde’
‘Vermijd voor altijd nabijheid’

Veel toeschouwers bleven staan om het schouwspel te bekijken. 
Sommige toeschouwers fluisterden: ‘Ja, hier gaan we naar toe, verschrikkelijk.” Anderen liepen stoïcijns voorbij. 

Deze ‘flashmob’ ontstond razendsnel en was ook zo weer verdwenen. 
Geïnspireerd op een actie eerder in de Zwitserse hoofdstad Bern waar een artistieke protestgroep genaamd Guerilla Mask Force Bern ook eenzelfde actie uitvoerde. 

En zoals een virus zich verspreid, heeft ook deze kunstvorm zich inmiddels door Europa verspreid. 

Als tegengeluid tegen de corona maatregelen die volgens de deelnemers de toekomst van onze wereld een heel stuk minder menselijk maakt. 

#GuerillaMaskForceBern
#wittepakkenmars
#GuerillaMaskForceNL 
#SlavenMars 

In more than 10 different cities in our country, a mysterious, artful protest march took place today.

Enschede, Sneek, Maastricht, Zwolle, Spijkenisse, The Hague, Tilburg and a number of other cities were surprised by a White Performance during the busy Black Friday weekend.
Participants were dressed in white suits with white masks.
Around the upper arm a black mourning band with a white cross on it.
A playful protest against the disproportionate corona measures.

To the beat of footsteps, these ""slaves"" were accompanied by speakers and a short robotic voice blared out, pronouncing words like:
""Thinking for yourself endangers the common good""
""Face masking duty for a lifetime""
""Vaccination deprive opponents of their rights""
""Body contact causes suffering""
""Only loneliness is safe""
""Always be obedient""
""Vaccination is charity""
""Avoid closeness forever""

Many spectators paused for it. 
Some spectators whispered: ""Yes, here we are going, terrible."" 
Others passed by stoically.

This ""flash mob"" arose very quickly and disappeared again.
Inspired by an action earlier in the Swiss capital Bern an artistic protest group called Guerilla Mask Force Bern also carried out a single action.
And just as a virus spreads, so has this art form established and spread throughout Europe.

In opposition to the corona measures that according to the participants make the future of our world a lot less human.

VuskwsIW02M,Dr. Trefor Bazett,UC9rTsvTxJnx1DNrDA3Rqa6A,1590013674.0,False Positives & Negatives for COVID-19 tests | Using Bayes' Theorem to Estimate Probabilities,"Suppose you test positive or negative for SARS-Cov-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. What are the chances you actually have the disease? In this video we're going to look at Bayes' Theorem from mathematics to help us compute the conditional probabilities. COVID-19 tests are actually in two categories, genetic tests and antibody tests, and both of these have different levels of sensitivity and specificity - i.e how accurate they are. While Genetic tests have extremely low false positive rates, some antibody tests do have higher false positive rates and, given the low prevalence in the general population, Bayes' theorem demonstrates how problematic this can actually be. 

Disclaimer: I'm not a medical doctor or epidemilogist, just a math prof, and so these toy examples are meant to illustrate the ideas of Bayes' theorem, not make actual concrete predictions based on a specific test.

z7TDn_LUM8I,Cafe Weltschmerz,UClK9f1anqhuSaqDN5YE-wfw,1597396129.0,Korte versie. Diederik Gommers herkent kritiek op gebruik PCR test: Flavio Pasquino en Mario Ortiz,"Bekijk hier de integrale versie https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktFDN5cBFgw&t=66s

Prof. dr. Diederik Gommers stuurde een bericht aan biochemicus drs. Mario Ortiz Buijsse via LinkedIn. In dat bericht gaf hij aan, het eens te zijn met hem, dat de PCR test waarmee we Covid-19 testen bij mensen, niets zegt over de klinische implicaties en het eventuele ziekteverloop. Sterker nog, volgens biochemicus Ortiz, is het veelal een klein stukje schroot en een - niet actief en in minuscul kleine getalen aanwezig - dood virusdeelje. Programmamaker, Flavio Pasquino interviewde deskundige Ortiz, over de waarde en betekenis van de PRC test methode en de rampzalige gevolgen ervan. Ze spraken over het bericht van prof. dr. Diederik Gommers en de ontwijkende antwoorden van prof. dr. Jaap van Dissel tijdens de technische briefing. Tevens analyseerden ze de technische briefing van de NOS op 11 aug jl. waar kamerleden vragen konden stellen aan het RIVM en de GGD. In de video refereert Flavio Pasquino naar een brief die Ortiz heeft verzonden aan alle kamerleden. De brief wordt in de uitzending slechts ten deel behandeld maar de integrale versie staat onder deze tekst.

De brief van Drs. Mario Ortiz Martinez:

*Foute interpretatie van positieve PCR uitslagen – Onterechte & foutieve ""besmettingen"" zorgt voor grove beleidsfouten*

Geachte Kamerleden,

U heeft het giga druk, dus ik val maar met de deur in huis met zeer belangrijke informatie, welke ik in het landsbelang acht, en waar u direct wat aan heeft:

Relevante introductie kort:
Ik ben moleculair geneticus, en ben dat vanuit de biochemie geworden aan de Rijksuniversiteit Leiden. Tevens inmiddels ook meer dan 20 jaar werkzaam in de farmaceutische & medische industrie.

Foute interpretatie van positieve PCR uitslagen – Onterechte & foutieve klinische extrapolatie zorgt voor grove beleidsfout.  
Ik heb zelf ruime ervaring met PCR, omdat dit in mijn universitaire vorming zat als biochemicus/moleculaire genetica hoofdvak. Dus ik weet goed hoe de vork in de steel zit.

Even los van de vraag, of de aan u gerapporteerde positieve PCR test aantallen nou procentueel erg weinig voorstellen, en er in relatieve zin eigenlijk weinig aan de hand is, is er iets veel wezenlijkers, wat u echt moet weten:
De GGD’s presenteren u een ‘toename’ in absolute cijfers van positieve PCR test uitslagen. (helaas niet procentueel...).
Een positieve PCR uitslag toont louter en alleen aan, of er bij iemand (een stukje) viraal RNA in neus slijmvies zat….

Cruciaal:
Iemand bij wie de test positief is, BETEKENT NIET, dat die persoon ook daadwerkelijk klinisch is geïnfecteerd, ziek is, of ziek gaat worden. Dat kan een PCR uitslag helemaal niet aantonen. Daar is deze moleculair biologische assay niet voor. Daar heb je namelijk extra klinische parameters voor nodig, want de PCR detecteert niet eens, of er intact virus RNA aanwezig was in de persoon, noch kun je iets zeggen of het virus infectieus is, of is geweest.

Ik maak mij ernstig zorgen, omdat u momenteel mogelijk (door toedoen van de media) onterecht de indruk heeft, dat het aantal potentieel zieke mensen met corona zal gaan toenemen, maar dat is dus niet correct!  
U, of een van uw medewerkers, kan mij contacten voor verdere toelichting hierover. Maar u kunt dit eigenlijk aan elke klinisch biochemicus vragen.


Zelf de Proef op de som nemen:
U kunt dit ook heel makkelijk zelf verifiëren. De GGD verzamelt al weken/maanden, al data van wie positief getest is (+ BCO). En aangezien de incubatie tijd van het virus zo ongeveer 1 week is (max 12 dagen), kunt u zowel retrospectief, alsook prospectief zo zien, of er allemaal extra zieken bij zijn gekomen, resp. bij zullen komen binnen ca. 1 week. Dat is niet het geval. En ik voorspel u, dat dit ook niet zal gebeuren. Een klein deel van echte corona zieken komt soms ook in ziekenhuis terecht, maar zoals u gezien heeft zitten ook de ziekenhuis opnames de afgelopen maanden op een nullijn. Dus u kunt eigenlijk al zien dat daar niets additiefs gebeurd is, of gebeurt. Dus hier aan kunt u al zien, dat die positieve PCR uitslagen nergens toe leiden.

U stuurt nu uw beleid en maatregelen op basis van angst voor extra “besmettingen”, maar voornoemde term is dus een zeer misleidende term voor de positieve PCR test uitslagen, die niets meer betekent, dan wat (vermoedelijk oudere) RNA fragmentjes van het virusgenoom, of soms zelfs een ander verwant virus. Het gaat daarbij ook nog eens om hooguit amper 1–2 % van alle geteste personen. Helaas blijft de media de term “besmettingen” maar gebruiken, maar zij realiseren zich niet wat de implicaties hiervan zijn, en weten zij niet eens wat PCR inhoudt. Ik wel. En vele vakgenoten met mij ook. 

U zult begrijpen, dat ik mij daarom ernstig zorgen maak, want ik zie dat er hele verkeerde conclusies worden getrokken, die het landsbelang ernstig schaden.


Met vriendelijke groeten,

Drs. Mario Ortiz Buijsse, biochemicus (moleculaire genetica), Medical Advisor Farma.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z7TDn_LUM8I/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-10 17:06:49.479832

Ninja Nerds,

Join us for our lecture on COVID-19 where Ninja Nerd Science will go into detail on the diagnostics used to diagnose COVID-19. This is our April update on our previous lecture to keep all of our viewers informed on the new research and publications that have been released on COVID-19. Please be aware— This lecture is up to date as of April 17, 2020. 

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

Immunofluorescence is a technique used for light microscopy with a fluorescence microscope and is used primarily on microbiological samples. This technique uses the specificity of antibodies to their antigen to target fluorescent dyes to specific biomolecule targets within a cell, and therefore allows visualisation of the distribution of the target molecule through the sample. Immunofluorescence is a widely used example of immunostaining and is a specific example of immunohistochemistry that makes use of fluorophores to visualise the location of the antibodies.
Immunofluorescence can be used on tissue sections, cultured cell lines, or individual cells, and may be used to analyse the distribution of proteins, glycans, and small biological and non-biological molecules. Immunofluoresence can be used in combination with other, non-antibody methods of fluorescent staining, for example, use of DAPI to label DNA. Several microscope designs can be used for analysis of immunofluorescence samples; the simplest is the epifluorescence microscope, and the confocal microscope is also widely used. Various super-resolution microscope designs that are capable of much higher resolution can also be used.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ysYsKmirKnI/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-11 14:53:52.627101

ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is a plate-based assay technique designed for detecting and quantifying substances such as peptides, proteins, antibodies and hormones. Other names, such as enzyme immunoassay (EIA), are also used to describe the same technology.

ELISAs are typically performed in 96-well (or 384-well) polystyrene plates, which passively bind antibodies and proteins. It is this binding and immobilization of reagents that makes ELISAs so easy to design and perform. Having the reactants of the ELISA immobilized to the microplate surface makes it easy to separate bound from non-bound material during the assay. This ability to wash away nonspecifically bound materials makes the ELISA a powerful tool for measuring specific analytes within a crude preparation.

A detection enzyme or other tag can be linked directly to the primary antibody or introduced through a secondary antibody that recognizes the primary antibody. It can also be linked to a protein such as streptavidin if the primary antibody is biotin labeled. The most commonly used enzyme labels are horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP). Other enzymes have been used as well, but they have not gained widespread acceptance because of limited substrate options. These include β-galactosidase, acetylcholinesterase and catalase. A large selection of substrates is available for performing ELISA with an HRP or AP conjugate. The choice of substrate depends upon the required assay sensitivity and the instrumentation available for signal-detection (spectrophotometer, fluorometer or luminometer).

Western blotting or western blot is a molecular detection technique to identify the presence of protein in a cellular extract or sample of mixture of proteins using the separation of proteins by SDS PAGE followed by the transfer of the protein gel into a nylon filter Membrane. Then the target protein is visualized by the treatment with horse radish peroxidase or with any radioactive isotope to find out the presence of target protein in the blot. Western blot is very sensitive that it can detect even nano gram of protein sample. This technique is also known as immunoblotting technique as it uses Antibody as a probe to bind to the target protein in the blot.

A Coombs test (also known as Coombs' test, antiglobulin test or AGT) is either of two clinical blood tests used in immunohematology and immunology. The two Coombs tests are the direct Coombs test (DCT, also known as direct antiglobulin test or DAT), and the indirect Coombs test (also known as indirect antiglobulin test or IAT).

The direct Coombs test is used to test for autoimmune hemolytic anemia; i.e., a condition of a low count of red blood cells (aka RBCs) caused by immune system lysis or breaking of RBC membranes causing RBC destruction.

In certain diseases or conditions, an individual's blood may contain IgG antibodies that can specifically bind to antigens on the RBC surface membrane, and their circulating RBCs can become coated with IgG alloantibodies and/or IgG autoantibodies. Complement proteins may subsequently bind to the bound antibodies and cause RBC destruction.[1] The direct Coombs test is used to detect these antibodies or complement proteins that are bound to the surface of red blood cells; a blood sample is taken and the RBCs are washed (removing the patient's own plasma) and then incubated with anti-human globulin (also known as ""Coombs reagent""). If this produces agglutination of RBCs, the direct Coombs test is positive, a visual indication that antibodies (and/or complement proteins) are bound to the surface of red blood cells.

The indirect Coombs test is used in prenatal testing of pregnant women and in testing blood prior to a blood transfusion. It detects antibodies against RBCs that are present unbound in the patient's serum. In this case, serum is extracted from the blood sample taken from the patient. Then, the serum is incubated with RBCs of known antigenicity; that is, RBCs with known reference values from other patient blood samples. If agglutination occurs, the indirect Coombs test is positive.[2]

The two Coombs tests are based on the fact that anti-human antibodies, which are produced by immunizing non-human species with human serum, will bind to human antibodies, commonly IgG or IgM. Animal anti-human antibodies will also bind to human antibodies that may be fixed onto antigens on the surface of red blood cells (also referred to as RBCs), and in the appropriate test tube conditions this can lead to agglutination of RBCs. The phenomenon of agglutination of RBCs is important here, because the resulting clumping of RBCs can be visualised; when clumping is seen the test is positive and when clumping is not seen the test is negative.

Common clinical uses of the Coombs test include the preparation of blood for transfusion in cross-matching, screening for atypical antibodies in the blood plasma of pregnant women as part of antenatal care, and detection of antibodies for the diagnosis of immune-mediated haemolytic anemias.

Examples of alloimmune hemolysis[edit]
Hemolytic disease of the newborn (also known as HDN or erythroblastosis fetalis)
Rh D hemolytic disease of the newborn (also known as Rh disease)
ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn (the indirect Coombs test may only be weakly positive)
Anti-Kell hemolytic disease of the newborn
Rh c hemolytic disease of the newborn
Rh E hemolytic disease of the newborn

For instance, the use of secondary antibodies:

• Requires a series of incubations and wash steps that are both tedious and time consuming.  It is amazing how many times people state how much they hate those wash steps!
 
• Can often be a source of non-specific staining within experiments which make data interpretation difficult or even impossible

• Multi-color analysis often results in cross species re-activity
 
Secondary antibodies are generally used either because there are no directly labeled primary antibodies or to increase sensitivity  

In this seminar, we will review:

• How labeling of your own antibodies overcomes the need for secondary antibodies 
 
• How easy it really is to label an antibody using Innova's 30 seconds hands-on antibody labeling kits and design your own unique research tools
 
• Application data such as flow cytometry and western blotting generated using directly labeled antibodies
 
• And question the hypothesis of secondary vs. primary labeled antibodies

The key reaction of immunology and immune defense is the interaction of antibodies and antigens. This interaction is responsible for the body's defense against viral and bacterial infections and other toxins. The body's defense mechanism recognizes foreign substances, or antigens, and raises specific antibodies against them.The antibodies bind to the antigens and form large macromolecular complexes. study involves use of an immunodiffusion technique in which antigen and antibody are allowed to diffuse in solid agarose medium.

The Ouchterlony Double Diffusion technique is based on the same principle of precipitation. In Ouchterlony double diffusion, both antigen and antibody are allowed to diffuse into the gel.  Antigens from different species are loaded into two wells and the known antibody is loaded in a third well located between and slightly below the antigen wells to form a triangle. Depending on the similarity between the antigens, different geometrical patterns are produced between the antigen and antiserum wells. The pattern of lines that form can be interpreted to determine whether the antigens are same or different.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hmK7yYr2T54/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-11 14:53:56.124596

Immunoelectrophoresis is a general name for a number of biochemical methods for separation and characterization of proteins based on electrophoresis and reaction with antibodies. All variants of immunoelectrophoresis require immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies reacting with the proteins to be separated or characterized. The methods were developed and used extensively during the second half of the 20th century. In somewhat chronological order: Immunoelectrophoretic analysis (one-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Grabar), crossed immunoelectrophoresis (two-dimensional quantitative immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Clarke and Freeman or ad modum Laurell), rocket-immunoelectrophoresis (one-dimensional quantitative immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Laurell), fused rocket immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Svendsen and Harboe, affinity immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Bøg-Hansen.

Agarose as 1% gel slabs of about 1 mm thickness buffered at high pH (around 8.6) is traditionally preferred for the electrophoresis as well as the reaction with antibodies. The agarose was chosen as the gel matrix because it has large pores allowing free passage and separation of proteins, but provides an anchor for the immunoprecipitates of protein and specific antibodies. The high pH was chosen because antibodies are practically immobile at high pH. An electrophoresis equipment with a horizontal cooling plate was normally recommended for the electrophoresis.

Immunoprecipitates may be seen in the wet agarose gel, but are stained with protein stains like Coomassie Brilliant Blue in the dried gel. In contrast to SDS-gel electrophoresis, the electrophoresis in agarose allows native conditions, preserving the native structure and activities of the proteins under investigation, therefore immunoelectrophoresis allows characterization of enzyme activities and ligand binding etc. in addition to electrophoretic separation.

The immunoelectrophoretic analysis ad modum Grabar is the classical method of immunoelectrophoresis. Proteins are separated by electrophoresis, then antibodies are applied in a trough next to the separated proteins and immunoprecipitates are formed after a period of diffusion of the separated proteins and antibodies against each other. The introduction of the immunoelectrophoretic analysis gave a great boost to protein chemistry, some of the very first results were the resolution of proteins in biological fluids and biological extracts. Among the important observations made were the great number of different proteins in serum, the existence of several immunoglobulin classes and their electrophoretic heterogeneity.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mhJzr_C2V6M/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-11 14:53:56.124596

Radial immunodiffusion (or Mancini method, Mancini immunodiffusion, single radial immunodiffusion assay) is an immunodiffusion technique used in immunology to determine the quantity of an antigen by measuring the diameters of circles of precipitin complexes surrounding samples of the antigen that mark the boundary between the antigen and an antibody suspended in a medium, such as an agar gel. The diameters of the circles increase with time as the antigen diffuses into the medium, reacts with the antibody, and forms insoluble precipitin complexes.

Antigen-antibody complexes are small and soluble when in antigen excess. Therefore, precipitation near the center of the circle is usually less dense than it is near the circle's outer edge, where antigen is less concentrated.

The quantity and concentration of insoluble antigen-antibody complexes at the outer edge of the circle increases with time. Therefore, the clarity and density of the outer edge increases with time.

Expansion of the circle reaches an end point and stops when antigen and antibody reach equivalence. However, the clarity and density of the outer edge may continue to increase after the circle stops expanding.

For most antigens, the area and the square of the diameter of the circle at the circle's end point are directly proportional to the quantity of antigen and are inversely proportional to the concentration of antibody. Therefore, a graph that compares the quantities or concentrations of antigen in the original samples with the areas or the squares of the diameters of the precipitin circles on linear scales will usually be a straight line when all circles have reached their end points (equivalence method). Circles created by small quantities of antigen reach their end points before large quantities do. Therefore, if areas or diameters of circles are measured while some, but not all, circles have stopped expanding, such a graph will be straight in the portion that contains the smaller quantities or concentrations of antigen and will be curved in the portion that contains the larger quantities or concentrations.

While circles are still expanding, a graph that compares the quantities or concentrations of the antigen on a logarithmic scale with the diameters or areas of the circles on a linear scale may be a straight line (kinetic method). However, circles of the precipitate are smaller and less distinct during expansion than they are after expansion has ended. Further, temperature affects the rate of expansion, but does not affect the size of a circle at its end point. In addition, the range of circle diameters for the same quantities or concentrations of antigen is smaller while some circles are enlarging than they are after all circles have reached their end points. Therefore, measurements of the sizes of circles and of graphs produced from such measurements are often less accurate when circles are expanding than they are after expansion has ended. For that reason, it is often more desirable to take measurements after all circles have reached their end points than it is to take measurements while some or all circles are still expanding.

Measurements of large circles are more accurate than are those of small circles. It is therefore often desirable to adjust the concentration of antibody and the quantity of antigen to assure that precipitin rings will be large.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xYRSRYZwDRs/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-11 14:53:56.423727

The complement fixation test is an immunological medical test that can be used to detect the presence of either specific antibody or specific antigen in a patient's serum. It was widely used to diagnose infections, particularly with microbes that are not easily detected by culture methods, and in rheumatic diseases. However, in clinical diagnostics labs it has been largely superseded by other serological methods such as ELISA and by DNA-based methods of pathogen detection, particularly PCR.
The complement system is a system of serum proteins that react with antigen-antibody complexes. If this reaction occurs on a cell surface, it will result in the formation of trans-membrane pores and therefore destruction of the cell. The basic steps of a complement fixation test are as follows:[1]

    Serum is isolated from the patient.
    Patients naturally have different levels of complement proteins in their serum. To negate any effects this might have on the test, the complement proteins in the patient's serum must be destroyed and replaced by a known amount of standardized complement proteins.
        The serum is heated in such a way that all of the complement proteins—but none of the antibodies—within it are destroyed. (This is possible because complement proteins are much more susceptible to destruction by heat than antibodies.)
        A known amount of standard complement proteins are added to the serum. (These proteins are frequently obtained from guinea pig serum.)
    The antigen of interest is added to the serum.
    Sheep red blood cells (sRBCs) [2] which have been pre-bound to anti-sRBC antibodies are added to the serum. The test is considered negative if the solution turns pink at this point and positive otherwise.

If the patient's serum contains antibodies against the antigen of interest, they will bind to the antigen in step 3 to form antigen-antibody complexes. The complement proteins will react with these complexes and be depleted. Thus when the sRBC-antibody complexes are added in step 4, there will be no complement left in the serum. However, if no antibodies against the antigen of interest are present, the complement will not be depleted and it will react with the sRBC-antibody complexes added in step 4, lysing the sRBCs and spilling their contents into the solution, thereby turning the solution pink.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QE4lBBphEio/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-11 14:53:56.424726

Then these bound antibody/antigen complexes are then added to an antigen coated well. After washing, unbound antibodies are removed. The more analytes in the sample, the less antibodies will be able to bind to antigens in the well. The signal is then detected using labeled secondary antibodies and the decrease in signal is compared to a control. The major advantage of a competitive ELISA is the ability to use crude or impure samples and still selectively bind any antigen that may be present.

""Hypersensitivity Type II also known as cytotoxic hypersensitivity reaction is where antibodies produced bind directly to antigens on the surface of a membrane and then activate the complement response. Complement response involves circulating proteins that when activated lead to an inflammatory response against a target. 

An example of hypersensitivity II reaction are antibodies mounted against drugs such as penicillin, hydrochlorothiazide and quinones that in rare cases can bind on to the surface of some cells subsequently activating the complement response. Antibodies can also be made that target some bacteria but accidentally cross react with human cells and then activate complement. Another good example is antibodies being formed against Rh+ RBC in a Rh - person.

In order for the antibodies to be made in the first place, there must be a first contact.""

Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms,[1including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.

The immune system protects organisms from infection with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, in the form of an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.
The complement system is a biochemical cascade that attacks the surfaces of foreign cells. It contains over 20 different proteins and is named for its ability to ""complement"" the killing of pathogens by antibodies. Complement is the major humoral component of the innate immune response. Many species have complement systems, including non-mammals like plants, fish, and some invertebrates.[33]

In humans, this response is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on the surfaces of microbes. This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response.[55] The speed of the response is a result of signal amplification that occurs after sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules, which are also proteases. After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback.[56] The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction. This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k9QAyP3bYmc/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-11 14:53:57.715532

2:58 – Type I (Type 1) HS 
6:48 – Anaphylactic Shock
7:45 – Type II (Type 2) HS 
8:57 – Type III (Type 3) HS and Immune Complexes
10:29 – Type IV (Type 4) HS

Hypersensitivity is when an otherwise healthy immune system has an undesirable exaggerated response to a foreign substance (or perceived foreign substance) that damages the body’s own cells. These are the same immune processes that are necessary to prevent infection, but they create problems when they are hyperactive or misguided. The way I remember the four different types of hypersensitivity is my ABCD mnemonic. 
I = Allergic Anaphylaxis and Atopy
II = antiBody 
III = immune Complex  
IV = Delayed 
* Types I, II and III all can involve antibodies. Therefore, having antibody in the mnemonic for type II may be confusing. However, the “classic” role of antibody involving complement activation, NK cell activation and opsonization are part of Type II which is why I feel that is the simplest way to remember it. 

Type I Hypersensitivity is triggered by an innocuous foreign substance (like dust, pollen or animal dander) that would cause no problems in the majority of people. The antigen simultaneously binds more than one membrane bound IgE on a mast cell (or basophil). This process, called Crosslinking, triggers the release of mast cell granules full of histamine. Histamine then goes on to signal the various changes associated with allergies similar to how it functions during acute inflammation. This allergic reaction happens almost instantly and the symptoms can become evident within minutes. This is possible because the mast cells are Pre-Sensitized to the innocuous substance which means they have pre-formed membrane bound IgE that recognizes the particular innocuous antigen. To be pre-sensitized the immune system must have seen the antigen previously, because antibody (IgE) formation takes time. Histamine’s role in Type I Hypersensitivity is why Anti-Histamines (Histamine Antagonists) like Diphenhydramine or Loratidine can control some allergy symptoms. 

Type I Hypersensitivity is the process that leads to various different “allergies”. A more mild form would include Allergic Rhinitis (seasonal allergies) that cause things like coughing, sneezing, watery eyes and nasal congestion. Some individuals with these allergies also experience an atopic rash referred to as Urticaria (Hives) or Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema). This red rash is raised and pruritic (itchy). Through a similar mechanism Type I Hypersensitivity can lead to exacerbation of Allergic Asthma by environmental triggers. This type of hypersensitivity is also the mechanism behind more serious conditions like peanut or bee sting allergies that can lead to swelling of the lips/tongue/throat, shortness of breath, stridor, and anaphylactic shock. Anaphylatic shock is a life threatening condition in which systemic histamine directed inflammation causes hypotension via global vasodilation, an increase in vascular permeability and significant fluid movement into the tissue. It is treated with epinephrine, often in the form of an “Epi Pen” when outside of a medical setting. Epinephrine activates Alpha-1 Adrenergic Receptors to raise blood pressure via vasoconstriction and increased contractility of the heart. 

Type II Hypersensitivity is the process by which IgG or IgM binds to a cell to cause injury or death (Antibody Dependent Cytotoxicity). This process has the same mechanism of action as normal humoral immunity except it is targeted at the body’s own cells instead of pathogens. The variable region of the antibody binds to the host cell while the constant portion interacts with NK cells, complement and macrophages. Examples of this reaction can be seen in Rheumatic Fever (body’s own cell look similar to Strep Pyo), Goodpasture Syndrome (Anti-Glomerular Basement Membrane Antibodies) and Hemolytic Disease of Newborns/Erythroblastosis Fetalis (when a Rh- mother has a second Rh+ child and the maternal IgG targets fetal RBCs).

It is caused by pre-formed IgE antibodies against harmless allergens. In other words, type 1 hypersensitivity is what you commonly known as allergy. Because it is caused by pre-formed antibodies, type 1 hypersensitivity reactions begin quickly, almost instantaneously after exposure. The immune response is divided into two phases, the early phase, and the less important late phase.

YGN1eEsD1uU,Hussain Biology,UCDCg5AAslixldHh5D7Nu6-g,1564842350.0,Alternative Pathway of Complement System,"The complement system is a part of the immune system that enhances (complements) the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear microbes and damaged cells from an organism, promote inflammation, and attack the pathogen's cell membrane. It is part of the innate immune system, which is not adaptable and does not change during an individual's lifetime. The complement system can, however, be recruited and brought into action by antibodies generated by the adaptive immune system.
The complement system consists of a number of small proteins that are synthesized by the liver, and circulate in the blood as inactive precursors. When stimulated by one of several triggers, proteases in the system cleave specific proteins to release cytokines and initiate an amplifying cascade of further cleavages.
Most of the proteins and glycoproteins that constitute the complement system are synthesized by hepatocytes. But significant amounts are also produced by tissue macrophages, blood monocytes, and epithelial cells of the genitourinary system and gastrointestinal tract. The three pathways of activation all generate homologous variants of the protease C3-convertase. The classical complement pathway typically requires antigen-antibody complexes for activation (specific immune response), whereas the alternative pathway can be activated by spontaneous complement component 3 (C3) hydrolysis, foreign material, pathogens, or damaged cells. The mannose-binding lectin pathway can be activated by C3 hydrolysis or antigens without the presence of antibodies (non-specific immune response). In all three pathways, C3-convertase cleaves and activates component C3, creating C3a and C3b, and causes a cascade of further cleavage and activation events. C3b binds to the surface of pathogens, leading to greater internalization by phagocytic cells by opsonization.

The classical pathway is triggered by activation of the C1-complex. The C1-complex is composed of 1 molecule of C1q, 2 molecules of C1r and 2 molecules of C1s, or C1qr2s2. This occurs when C1q binds to IgM or IgG complexed with antigens. A single pentameric IgM can initiate the pathway, while several, ideally six, IgGs are needed. This also occurs when C1q binds directly to the surface of the pathogen. Such binding leads to conformational changes in the C1q molecule, which leads to the activation of two C1r molecules. C1r is a serine protease. They then cleave C1s (another serine protease). The C1r2s2 component now splits C4 and then C2, producing C4a, C4b, C2a, and C2b (historically, the larger fragment of C2 was called C2a but is now referred to as C2b). C4b and C2b bind to form the classical pathway C3-convertase (C4b2b complex), which promotes cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b. C3b later joins with C4b2b to make C5 convertase (C4b2b3b complex).
This change in shape allows the binding of plasma protein Factor B, which allows Factor D to cleave Factor B into Ba and Bb.

Bb remains bound to C3(H2O) to form C3(H2O)Bb. This complex is also known as a fluid-phase C3-convertase. This convertase, the alternative pathway C3-convertase, although only produced in small amounts, can cleave multiple C3 proteins into C3a and C3b. The complex is believed to be unstable until it binds properdin, a serum protein. The addition of properdin forms the complex C3bBbP, a stable compound which can bind an additional C3b to form alternative pathway C5-convertase.

The C5-convertase of the alternative pathway consists of (C3b)2BbP (sometimes referred to as C3b2Bb). After the creation of C5 convertase (either as (C3b)2BbP or C4b2a3b from the classical pathway), the complement system follows the same path regardless of the means of activation (alternative, classical, or lectin). C5-convertase cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. C5b binds sequentially to C6, C7, C8 and then to multiple molecules of C9 to form membrane attack complex.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YGN1eEsD1uU/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-11 14:53:58.112693

F_ssj7-8rYg,TED-Ed,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA,1600843434.0,The surprising effects of pregnancy,"Discover how pregnancy changes every organ in the body— from the heart, to the brain and kidneys— and what we still don’t know about it.

--

Muscles and joints shift and jostle. The heart’s pounding rhythm speeds up. Blood roars through arteries and veins. Over the course of a pregnancy, every organ in the body changes. Initiated by a range of hormones, these changes begin as soon as a pregnancy begins. Explore what we know— and don’t know— about pregnancy's effects on the body and brain.

Lesson by TED-Ed, directed by Roxane Campoy and Charlotte Cambon.

Today, about one-tenth of the world’s population are southpaws. Why are such a small proportion of people left-handed -- and why does the trait exist in the first place? Daniel M. Abrams investigates how the uneven ratio of lefties and righties gives insight into a balance between competitive and cooperative pressures on human evolution.

We hear anywhere from 10 to 200 lies a day. And although we’ve spent much of our history coming up with ways to detect these lies by tracking physiological changes in their tellers, these methods have proved unreliable. Is there a more direct approach? Noah Zandan uses some famous examples of lying to illustrate how we might use communications science to analyze the lies themselves.

It’s often said that despite humanity’s many conflicts, we all bleed the same blood. It’s a nice thought, but not quite accurate. In fact, our blood comes in a few different varieties. Natalie S. Hodge defines the four major blood types and sheds light on why some bloods can mix while others cannot.

In this video, I offer a few tips and demonstrate how to take a pregnancy test at home. I show a side-by-side comparison of a positive pregnancy test result vs a negative pregnancy test result. I also show a time lapse of the pregnancy test progress, and I explain the control vs test lines as well.

For the demonstration, I used a pregnancy test called ""Assured,"" which I bought at the Dollar Tree. (Yes, those Dollar Tree pregnancy tests actually work, and they accurately tested positive for both of my pregnancies!)

Pregnancy tests like the one I used in this video detect a hormone called hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin). This  hormone is released after the placenta attaches to the uterine wall.

It is best to take a pregnancy test in the morning, as that is when hCG leves are supposed to be most concentrated.

--

In 1948, Spanish ophthalmologist Jose Ignacio Barraquer Moner was fed up with glasses. He wanted a solution for blurry vision that fixed the eye itself, without relying on external aids. The surgery he eventually devised was called “keratomileusis,” and his technique focused on reshaping the cornea— what we now know as LASIK. So how does laser eye surgery actually work? Dan Reinstein explains.

Immunoelectrophoresis is a general name for a number of biochemical methods for separation and characterization of proteins based on electrophoresis and reaction with antibodies. All variants of immunoelectrophoresis require immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies reacting with the proteins to be separated or characterized.

Balancing children’s and faculty’s lives while trying to figure out how to best educate children is an extremely complicated issue, so I decided to take some more time to really make sure we get it right. I’d rather not race to be the first person to discuss an issue, but rather spend time to ensure my thoughts and message are helpful and based in only the facts. So, while I continue to research the issue of children returning to school, I took a quick break to laugh at some new medical memes!

Even though it’s been several days now, and we’ve known this was possible for months, it’s still so bizarre to read. Unfortunately, the tragedy of COVID-19 does not just stop at the infection of people like Donald Trump, but rather extends to the megaphones of our most mainstream media outlets. I’ve been in more Twitter feuds over the last week than I have been in my entire life on the platform, arguing with contributors to outlets like CNN, The Washington Post, and Fox News, among others. It seems to me that this virus and our political vitriol towards each other has caused us to lose all sense of logic and decency.

EMThHM-YD5k,John Thomas,UC-qa0WtQb1Ly-u9ZjYN2yJg,1389706607.0,Video 16 Antibody Immunoglobulin Immune Function,"16) Immunoglobulin Function of the five antibodies

Let's take a closer look at the five types of antibody immunoglobulins. 

IgAs are not typically found in the blood, but in secretions of the gut, saliva, sweat, milk, respiratory track, and urinary track. IgAs are part of our innate immunity and fight pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, fungus and worms. There are two types of IgAs. 

IgDs are primarily found on the surface of B-cells and account for a very tiny portion of the free floating antibodies found in plasma. And while IgDs are the least well know antibody, they are known to play a role in the activation of basophils and mast cells to attack invading microbes. 

IgEs respond to allergens, such as pollen as well as parasitic worms. IgEs bind to mast cells and basophils. Once the IgE receptor comes into contact with one of these antigens the mast cells and basophils will release histamine molecules, causing the inflammatory symptoms we know as an allergic reaction. 

There are four types of IgGs. IgGs target pathogenic organisms, such as bacteria, viruses and parasites. They attach to an antigen on one end while the opposite end binds with phagocytic white cells (macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells) to absorb and destroy the antigen. IgGs are the primary antibody of the human body, accounting for 70-80% of the entire immunoglobulin pool. It is the smallest Ig molecule, allowing it to easily migrate into the tissues of the body. Only 45% are found in the blood. Almost every man made monoclonal antibody in clinical use is in the IgG family. 

IgMs are early responders and function to eliminate pathogens early on in the attack before there are sufficient levels of IgGs. IgMs are known as a macroglobulin because of their large size. They are the largest of the immunoglobulins and make up 6-10% of the total Ig pool.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EMThHM-YD5k/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-11 14:54:01.663622
o9EaEtD_GXY,Southern California Food Allergy Institute,UCbMoed9vCJabC2HLYiQ7Cng,1591221871.0,COVID 19 Testing Explained,"Dr. Randhawa explains why we are performing both the PCR and Antibody tests for the virus in this video. Performing both tests provides a comprehensive approach to determine if a person actively has the virus or has had the virus previously. Without both tests being performed, many are left to guess their actual exposure which does not help address personal and public health concerns.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o9EaEtD_GXY/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-11 14:54:01.663622
NTFvzwdIv4k,Frank Lectures,UCFAQwnv2kGxl_2BOrI6790A,1499921330.0,"IgG: Structure, Properties and Functions (FL-Immuno/38)","In this video lecture we'll discuss the structure, properties and mechanism of action of IgG antibody class.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NTFvzwdIv4k/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-11 14:54:01.663622
puyBubPeZGg,Beckman Coulter Dx,UCxhDBhx2j1R0_tsXuJTmplA,1597786309.0,IgM and IgG antibodies represent different stages of an immune response against COVID-19,"The presence of #IgM and #IgG antibodies represent different stages of a body's immune response against the #coronavirus. 

An IgM antibody test has an important role to play because IgM #antibodies typically appear earlier during infection. So an IgM assay can act as a confirmatory test for a PCR test. For example, if a clinician gives a PCR test to someone and it comes back negative, but they have a feeling that the patient truly has an infection, IgM would be a great test to use on that patient to get
a second confirmation.

Combined assays that detect both IgM and IgG antibodies are problematic because clinicians won't know what part of the immune response they are actually measuring. They are simply getting a single number, and don't know if that number is caused by IgM, that early immune response that is fleeting, or by IgG, which is indicative of a longer-lasting immune response. 

This confusion will lead to the need for additional testing. So for example, if a total antibody test is positive, a clinician would have to follow up with an IgM test, Novus IgM, or perhaps a PCR test to measure active infection or an IgG test to know if that patient has reached a longer-lasting immune response.

The advantage of a standalone IgG test is that it is a much more specific test. Clinicians know they are measuring IgG antibodies, which are more indicative of that longer-term immune response that they are looking for.

But physicists have long puzzled over the absence of antimatter. Theories say that antimatter should have been produced by the Big Bang just as matter was and in equal amounts. Now a huge experiment in Japan may have found a subtle imbalance which could help explain why our universe is the way it is. Reporter Elizabeth Gibney explores the concept of CP violation and explains what the new results could mean.

Que retenir de cet épisode ?
Le principe du test RT-qPCR (ou test moléculaire) est d’amplifier une séquence d’ADN, spécifique du SARS-CoV-2, à partir de l’ARN extrait de l’échantillon prélevé sur l’individu. Les tests sérologiques permettent eux de détecter, non pas directement le SARS-CoV-2, mais les anticorps anti- SARS-CoV-2, indiquant que l’on a été en contact avec le virus. Ces tests sont complémentaires et sont utilisés à différents moments de l’infection d’un individu. Ensemble, ils devraient donc permettre une meilleure prise en charge thérapeutique et un meilleur contrôle de l’épidémie.

--

Your hands, up close, are anything but smooth. With peaks and valleys, folds and rifts, there are plenty of hiding places for a virus to stick. If you then touch your face, the virus can infect you. But there are two extraordinarily simple ways you can keep that from happening: soap and water, and hand sanitizer. So which is better? Alex Rosenthal and Pall Thordarson investigate.

Over the last decade milk has become a bit controversial. Some people say it’s a necessary and nutritious food, vital for healthy bones, but others say it can cause cancer and lead to an early death.

So who is right? And why are we drinking it anyway?

The observable universe is a big place that has been around for more than 13 billion years. Up to two trillion galaxies made up of  something like 20,000 billion billion stars surround our home galaxy. In the milky way alone scientists assume there are some 40 billion earth like planets in the habitable zone of their stars. When we look at these numbers it is hard to imagine  that there is nobody else out there.

Influenza, or the flu, is a contagious viral infection that attacks your nose, throat, and lungs. It can cause fever, chills, runny nose, sore throat, cough, muscle aches, and fatigue. The flu virus is extremely small and only visible through electron microscopes. Inside the virus, genetic material contains the information to make more copies of the same virus. A protein shell provides a hard, protective enclosure for the genetic material as the virus travels between the people or animals it infects. An outer envelope allows the virus to infect cells by merging with the cell's outer membrane. Projecting from the envelope are spikes of protein molecules. The flu virus uses its H spikes like a key to get inside your cells. N spikes allow copies of the virus to break away from your infected cells to infect more cells. There are 17 known types of H spikes and nine types of N spikes that scientists use to name different flu viruses, such as the virus H5N1. You get the flu by touching an object that has the flu virus on it or through exposure to body fluids from people or animals infected with the virus. When an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes, droplets carrying the influenza virus may land in your mouth or nose and then move into your lungs. Once inside your body, the influenza virus comes into contact with cells in your nose, throat, or lungs. The H spike on the virus inserts into a receptor molecule on your healthy cell membrane, like a key in a lock. This action allows the virus to get inside your cell. Next, the virus travels inside a sack made from your cell membrane to your cell's nucleus. Then the viral envelope and cell membrane sack combine, allowing the viral genetic material to leave the sack and enter the nucleus. The viral genetic material hijacks the energy and materials in your cell's nucleus to make thousands of copies of itself. Some of the genetic material moves out of the nucleus, then attaches to ribosomes, which are the protein building parts of your cell. Ribosomes use information from the genetic material to make other viral proteins, such as the H and N spikes. A packaging structure in your cell, called the Golgi apparatus, carries the H and N spikes in vesicles which merge with your cell's membrane. All the parts needed to create a new virus gather just beneath your cell's membrane. Then a new virus begins to bud off from the cell's membrane. During this process, the newly created virus gets stuck on your cell's membrane when a viral H spike locks onto membrane receptors. However, the virus has a way to get around this problem. The viral N spike frees the virus by cutting it away from the receptor. New influenza viruses are now free to infect more of your cells and cause you to develop the flu. If you have the flu, your doctor may prescribe Oseltamivir, which you would take orally, or Zanamivir, which you would take using an inhaler, to help speed your recovery or reduce your risk for complications. These anti-viral drugs stop the influenza virus by blocking the viral N spike from freeing the virus. This causes the new viruses to stick to the surface of your cell, so they cannot escape and infect more of your cells. The best way to protect yourself from the flu is to get the flu vaccine every year. You may receive the vaccine as a shot, which contains dead versions of several types of the virus, or you may receive it as a nasal spray, which contains several types of live, but very weak, forms of the virus. The vaccine exposes your body to several types of the influenza virus that are too weak to cause infection but just strong enough to stimulate an immune response. Within two weeks, cells in your immune system make markers called antibodies, which are specific for only the types of flu you were exposed to. The antibodies attach to each flu virus and prevent it from attaching to your cells. Antibodies are also able to attach to more than one flu virus, which causes viruses to clump together. Your immune system responds to signals from the antibodies by engulfing and destroying the clumps of viruses. Later, if you are exposed to these types of flu again, your body recognizes and destroys them, so you will not develop the flu from these same viruses. For continued protection against new flu viruses, you will need to get a flu vaccine every year.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Omi0IPkNpY/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-11 14:54:03.731867

HD__r66sFjk,Chris Notap,UCrnCSQJB4c1_rOKJRzSZemg,1508515777.0,How Smoking 30 PACKS of Cigarettes Wrecks Your Lungs ● You Must See This !,"This shows smoking a pack a day for 30 days! That's 600 cigarettes!  The average American smoker smokes a pack a day. This is what could be going in your lungs. 

● same experiment SMOKING only one Cigarette    https://youtu.be/YS02MCx9f2c
● same experiment SMOKING 1 pack of Cigarettes a Day    https://youtu.be/AQwIDiL8gOM
● same experiment SMOKING vs VAPING for a Month       https://youtu.be/0Pwj6BuS8Ds

------------------ EXPLANATION of the test --------------------------

* This is not a scientific test. Visually shows what is going in your lungs

* The average American smoker smokes one pack a day = 30 packs a month (Google)

* 30 packs x 20 per pack = 600 cigarettes.

* The smoke was not held. Exhale hose clearly shown at 0:15

* if all the smoke had been blown back through the cotton, like real smoking, the results would have been even worse!

* The smoke was drawn through and around the cotton, catching some, not all, of the chemicals and tar, evident by the accumulation in the hoses. 

* The machine smoked each cigarette at the same pace.  

* Each cigarette was smoked 3/4 of the way to reflect real world smoking allowing a quarter of it to just burn away while talking or thinking.

* It took 3 days for the machine to smoke all of the cigarettes.
 
* The chamber was cleared of smoke between each and every cigarette allowing air to enter. 

* Scenes were sped up and time lapsed to be able to see the visual change in colour occur.
 
* The black stuff is called tar. Heavy accumulation of tar in the hoses showed up after only 10 packs. Tar from the next 20 packs overflowed and got sucked into the pump. It eventually ruined the pump.

* Lungs do self clean to take care of dust and debris from normal breathing in the environment.  They weren't meant to be overwhelmed on an hourly basis by smoke from a burning object for life.

* The smell inside the dome at the end was vile. I felt quite ill afterwards. Can't imagine how a smoker feels on a daily basis. 

* I think everyone agrees we must do our part to give kids a good start in life and do our best to prevent youngsters from taking up these very poor habits including vaping. If you are one of those people that smokes tobacco, cannabis or vapes, never let children or kids see you do it. If kids see an adult doing it, they think it's ok. If you must do it, make sure you are out of sight at home, near schools, around arenas or at parks. Do your part to help everyone raise healthy kids!

* just remember this one simple rule and you can't go wrong...."".your lungs were only meant for one thing and that's air""

This video, created by Nucleus Medical Media, shows high blood pressure, or hypertension. This is a common condition in which the force of blood on the walls of your arteries is often too high. While your blood pressure may change throughout the day, it should normally be less than 120 millimeters of mercury for systolic pressure, and less than 80 millimeters of mercury for diastolic pressure. If your systolic pressure frequently stays above 140, or your diastolic pressure frequently stays above 90, you have high blood pressure.

If you have obstructive sleep apnea, your breathing pauses for brief periods while you're asleep. Normally when you breathe in, air flows in through your mouth and nose and down your throat, also called the pharynx. Air then slows down your windpipe, or trachea, spreading through a tree-like structure of smaller tubes into your lungs. 

Each time you breathe in, negative suction pressure pulls the soft tissues in your mouth and pharynx inward. The muscles in your pharynx respond by pulling the soft tissues outward again, which keeps your airway open. 

When you sleep, it's normal for the muscles in your mouth, tongue, and pharynx to relax slightly, but not enough to block your airway. If you have obstructive sleep apnea, the muscles of your mouth and pharynx may relax too much. Your tongue drops onto the soft tissue in the roof of your mouth, pressing it against the back of your throat. This completely blocks the flow of air into your lungs. The lack of oxygen in your lungs wakes you up. You may gasp for air to reestablish air flow before falling asleep again. 

The cycle of apnea and waking up may happen many times at night, preventing restful sleep. Factors that may contribute to obstructive sleep apnea include obesity, because more fat may be present in the walls of the pharynx, a small or receding jaw with a narrowed airway, loss of muscle tone in your pharynx due to aging, and swollen tonsils. 

Common symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea are snoring, morning headaches, chronic daytime sleepiness, fatigue, irritability, and impaired concentration. Left untreated, obstructive sleep apnea may lead to complications, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, irregular heart beats, called arrhythmias, stroke, and diabetes. 

Your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes to treat obstructive sleep apnea, including losing weight, sleeping on your side, not smoking, and avoiding substances that can make you sleepy, such as alcohol and sedatives. 

For mild or moderate obstructive sleep apnea, an oral appliance may keep your airway open. This device works by pulling your jaw forward and moving both your tongue and the roof of your mouth away from the back of your throat. 

The most common and effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea is a continuous positive airway pressure or CPAP machine. This machine pumps air through a tube into a mask that fits over your nose or both your nose and mouth. The mild air pressure of the CPAP machine helps keep your airway open, enabling you to get a deep, restful sleep.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i6lxO6W2-m8/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-11 14:54:04.462723

u3BVke4C8Sc,Physiology Open,UCp10Y8hxSVZ7j4d797oEfUA,1585392819.0,Structure of coronavirus with classification of viruses,"Viruses can only survive within a host cell so that applied to coronavirus as well. Viruses have a genetic material which enables them to reproduce however they do not have enzymes required for protein as well as nucleic acid synthesis so they need help of some other cells so that they use their machinery and produce proteins and enzymes necessary for their protection as well as for their multiplication. 

Structures of virus

All viruses have a genome which is surrounded by a protein coat known as capsid.  The protein coat i.e the capsid is basically proteins which are arranged in a symmetrical manner and form a protective shell for the nucleic acid. The symmetry may be either icosahedral i.e has 20 triangular faces or helical. So all viruses have a genome and a protein coat . Some viruses may be enveloped while some may not be enveloped (naked viruses). The envelope is made up of lipoproteins i.e lipids and proteins. The lipids are derived from the host cell membrane which the viruses infect and they acquire it while they are leaving the cell while the proteins are synthesised by the viral genome using the host machinery.

Viruses have been broadly classified into 6 types based on their genome

1. 1st class includes viruses with double stranded DNA, 
2. 2nd class, viruses with single stranded DNA, 
3. 3rd class : viruses with ds RNA viruses 
in 4th , 5th and 6th class are ss RNA viruses with some differences.
4. 4th class, viruses with positive strand ss RNA i.e RNA same as that of mRNA which can be directly translated into proteins 
5. 5th class, ss RNA viruses with RNA of opposite polarity to that of mRNA are present i.e negative starnad RNA
6.In 6th class ss RNA viruses are there but these viruses have the capability to synthesise DNA from their RNA since they possess an enzyme reverse transcriptase. 

Structure of coronaviruses

Coronaviruses belong 4th class…i.e they have singly stranded positive sense RNA with a protein coat. Coronavirus genome is very large infact it is among the largest mature RNA virus molecules known and second the nucleocapsid has helical symmetry.  Also, the coronaviruses are enveloped virus i.e apart from the protein coat they also have a lipoprotein envelope. 

The lipoprotein envelope has lipids derived from the host cell membrane and the proteins in this envelope are synthesised from the viral genome. One of these proteins known as spike protein  kind of forms a rim around the membrane. This rim gives it an appearnace similar to corona of the sun  and thats why this virus is name as coronavirus. This spike protein is the one through which virus attaches to a receptor, and then the virus and host cell membrane fuse causing entry of viral genome into the cell. 

There are 2 other proteins.. one is known as membrane protein M protein which gives the virus envelope its shape while the other is E-protein i.e envelope protein… They are said to have roles in the assembly of the virus genome , capsid and the envelope as the virus leaves the host cell.

Content review provided by experts from CDC, IFRC and UNICEF.

This animated film follows two people who go to a market and shows how they spread the virus to others. Eventually, their whole neighborhood gets infected. The film then explains ways we can protect ourselves and those around us. The story will continue in Part 2, in which a woman gets sick. Her family stays home so they don’t infect others, and shows the rules to follow to care for her safely.
 
The film makes the invisible coronavirus visible, and helps people grasp transmission in a simple and visual way. Through our experience with our animated films on cholera and Ebola, we learned that the image of the visible germ stays with people, helping them make the necessary behavior changes to protect themselves and others and prevent the disease from spreading.

This film is intended to help meet the need for better education and awareness that is critical in slowing and reversing the spread of this disease worldwide.

""You look great! Have you lost weight?"" - I was always a little bigger than my friends, but hearing that comment drove me to go beyond the extremes of losing weight; I became anorexic. 

These days, being skinny or ""fit"" is the new pretty. Even on Instagram, those that are skinny or in workout clothes get the most likes because that's what is deemed ""beautiful"". We constantly compare ourselves to these ""beautiful"" individuals making it our goal to get to where they are. Everything from dieting, becoming gym junkies, skipping meals, or even plastic surgery. As we continue our quest, no matter how hard or how much we view the mirror or whatever compliments we receive, it's never enough; I'm still fat. 

Anorexia Nervosa is a mental illness eating disorder with the person having a strong desire to be thin, creating unhealthy eating habits and harming the individuals' overall health. 

Signs of Anorexia are (not limited to):
- Low body mass index
- Restricting food intake
- Excessive use of Laxatives, diet pills, and purging food after meals. 
- Denial of body image
- Obsessive fear of obesity
are amongst the limited signs of Anorexia.

Following is the transcript of the video:

You’re about an hour and a half into the movie and, boy, are you regretting that large soda. You can hold it... but should you?

Peeing is pretty important. Your kidneys filter excess water and waste out of your blood and that urine needs somewhere to go: your bladder. Normally, it’ll hold 1-2 cups comfortably. But if you make a habit of holding your pee for long periods of time, you can actually stretch your bladder to easily hold even more.

Case in point, one study found that nurses who often held it in all day due to job constraints had nearly double the normal bladder capacity! And they were totally fine.

But this doesn’t mean you should hold it in if you can help it. Because your bladder may not be the only thing to stretch.

You may also stretch your external sphincter muscles. Those are important muscles connected to the outside of your bladder that are the gate-keepers of your golden liquid. Clench them and you hold in the gold. Relax them and you release the flood! But if you overstretch them, you can actually lose control. This is rare, and usually takes decades of holding it too long to reach that point, but once you do, it can lead to some awkward or even dangerous situations.

For example, with less overall control, you risk leaking urine when your bladder is full and not emptying it all the way when you finally do go. Not only can this increase your need to urinate more often since your bladder fills up quicker, it can also lead to a serious disorder called urinary retention, where you end up with too much urine in your bladder for too long. And since your bladder is basically a warm, wet bag of body waste, it’s the PERFECT breeding ground for harmful bacteria that’ll cause all sorts of damage.

Even worse, if you’re really unlucky and retain too much urine, it may back up into your kidneys. Which could lead to kidney failure, and ultimately death.

The good news is that you’re more likely to just lose control of your muscles and pee waaaay before your bladder hits that point. But why not just reduce the risk all together and go to the bathroom?

Ok, ok, we get it. That movie is absolutely gripping. Luckily... You’ll be fine if you only hold it in for a short time, every once in a while. So go ahead, hang in there... just don’t make a habit of it.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KCWEedgFNCk/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-11 14:54:05.276430

12:30 - Minimize the chances of having severe disease if you were to get COVID

This is the link to the main study in this video:
https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2003

In all 12 Coronavirus Autopsy cases, the cause of death was found within the lungs or the pulmonary vascular system. For the ones who did not die of large pulmonary emboli, they died of the extensive inflammation within the lungs, meaning pneumonia with ARDS. In these Coronavirus Autopsy cases, the lungs were wet and heavy, much like a sponge that is saturated with water. The surfaces of the lung often had a distinct patchy pattern, with pale areas alternating with slightly protruding and firm, deep reddish-blue Hypercapillarized areas. This is indicative of areas of intense inflammation, with endothelial dysfunction that can be seen at the microscopic level. When they look at slices of the lungs under the microscope, they found diffuse alveolar damage in 8 Coronavirus Autopsy cases. Specifically, they saw hyaline membrane formation, and tiny clots in the capillaries, and capillaries that were engorged with red blood cells, and other inflammatory findings. All these findings represent ARDS. They also found lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, infiltrated these areas of infiltration.  This fits the picture of viral pathogenesis.

They also looked at the pharynx of these COVID 19 patients, meaning in their throat. The lining of the throat, or mucosa, was hyperemic, meaning very red and irritated, and at the microscopic level, they saw lymphocytes invading there, which is consistent with a viral infection. In one Coronavirus case, a COVID patient had lymphocytes invade his heart muscle, findings that are consistent with what we call viral myocarditis. More than half of the COVID patients in this study had large blood clots. One-third of the COVID 19 patients had pulmonary embolism as the direct cause of death. All the others died of intense inflammation in their lungs related to pneumonia with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). Recently there’s been studies showing that about 1/3rd of COVID patients with severe COVID have blood clots. In another study of 191 COVID patients with coronavirus aka COVID 19, half of those who died had clots, compared with 7% of survivors. And levels of D-dimer that were greater than 1000 µg/L were associated with a fatal outcome. So it's pretty clear now that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is causing a lot of clots to form in moderate to severe COVID disease.

How is this happening? 
It's likely a combination of reasons, that has to do with downregulation of the ACE2 receptor in the lung alveoli, with a subsequent shift towards having more angiotensin II in the lungs, and less angiotensin 1-7 and 1-9 in the lungs, and when this happens, this leads to more cytokine storm with more inflammation, more constriction of pulmonary arteries, and more clots that develop. That, in turn, leads to more endothelial dysfunction in the capillaries that surround the alveoli. Also, there is evidence that the virus attaches to the ACE2 receptors of those endothelial cells that line those capillaries, which further propagates inflammation and clotting. And in the cytokine storm that develops there, RANTES, a chemokine, binds to the CCR5 receptor of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes, and that causes those lymphocytes to infiltrate those areas of inflammation, and in doing so, further contributes towards the inflammatory reaction. This is why we are seeing low levels of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes in severe COVID. Endothelial damage can also lead to the development of antiphospholipid antibodies, and these antibodies are bad because they trigger the formation of blood clots. That’s why Coronavirus patients who have clots with the diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome need to be on blood thinners. 

Also, 11 out of the 12 Coronavirus patients in this study had underlying heart disease and were obese. These are known risk factors not just for cardiovascular disease, but also known risk factors for endothelial dysfunction, and are known risk factors for COVID.  So the big takeaways from the findings in this study are that most people who die of COVID 19, it's primarily a lung problem. Either related to inflammation with ARDS and/or blood clots.

Antiphospholipid syndrome might be a commonality among patients with thrombosis in COVID patients.

Zinc balances immune responses and also has a proven direct antiviral action against some viruses.

Zinc deficiency (ZD) is a common condition in elderly and individuals with chronic diseases

Increased intracellular zinc concentrations efficiently impair replication

Resulting in a lower number of viruses

Retrospective analysis

Patients admitted in Barcelona

15th March to 30th April 2020

Clinical severity of COVID-19 and PMH assessed

Fasting plasma zinc levels measured routinely at admission

N = 611

Mean age, 63 years

Male 332, (55%) 

Total mortality was 87 patients (14%) during study time

But

249 of 611 patients studied

Of the 249, 21 (8%) died

Baseline zinc levels

Died, (21 people) mean plasma zinc = 43 μg/dl

Survived, (228 people) mean plasma zinc = 63.1 μg/dl

Higher zinc levels, associated with lower maximum levels of interleukin-6 during the period of active infection

Zinc level lower than 50 μg/dl at admission, 2.3 times increased risk of in-hospital death

Compared with those of 50 μg/dl or higher

Lower zinc levels at admission correlate with higher inflammation in the course of infection and poorer outcome 

Low plasma zinc levels at admission are associated with mortality in COVID-19 in our study 

Further studies are needed to assess the therapeutic impact of this association

COVID-19: Poor outcomes in patients with zinc deficiency (International Journal of Infectious Diseases, November 2020)

Chennai, India

Prospective study of fasting zinc levels in COVID-19 patients at the time of hospitalization

Healthy controls median 105.8 μg/dl

Zinc is a trace element with potent immunoregulatory and antiviral properties

Is utilized in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

Patients with serious COVID-19 had significantly low zinc levels in comparison to healthy controls

Zinc deficient COVID patients developed more complications

Zinc deficient patients 70.4% developed complications

Non zinc deficient patients, 30.0% developed complications, (p = 0.009)

Acute respiratory distress syndrome

More need of steroids

Increased mortality

Zinc deficient COVID patients had a prolonged hospital stay

Zinc deficient patients, 7.9 days

Non zinc deficient patients, 5.7 days, (p = 0.048)

In vitro studies

Reduced zinc levels increase SARS-CoV-2 virus receptor interactions

Increased zinc levels inhibit ACE2 expression

What zinc does

Catalytic activity of approximately 100 enzymes 

Plays a role in immune function

Protein synthesis

Wound healing

DNA synthesis 

Cell division

Normal growth and development, pregnancy, childhood, adolescence

Required for sense of taste and smell

Zinc and immunity

Severe zinc deficiency depresses immune function

Even mild to moderate degrees of zinc deficiency can impair macrophage and neutrophil functions, natural killer cell activity, and complement activity

Body requires zinc to develop and activate T-lymphocytes

Low zinc levels have shown reduced lymphocyte proliferation

…. that can be corrected by zinc supplementation 

Low zinc status has been associated with increased susceptibility to pneumonia and other infections in children in developing countries and the elderly

COVID Update Today by Doctor Mike Hansen (YouTube Video Playlist)
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgqCliyXQhezro4JBt2zJDWo7XdCTn_45

Every fall and winter - coughing, sneezing, and sniffling, and the like. 
Is it the common cold? 
Is it the Flu? or
It is COVID 19? 

All 3 of these have overlapping symptoms. And COVID 19 cases are already starting to increase in the US with the cold weather, which is just the beginning of the 2nd surge that everyone is talking about. COVID 19, flu, and common colds are all caused by viruses. 

Relevant Videos mentioned in this video :
Airborne Transmission - https://youtu.be/xJ4Epf8i1uk
Long Haulers COVID 19 - https://youtu.be/GuA8umd9txI
Pulse Oximeter for COVID 19 - https://youtu.be/3siQzuXP3qE
Rapid Antigen Test for COVID 19 - https://youtu.be/3siQzuXP3qE

These tiny infectious agents can survive only by getting inside the cells of animals or humans. There are more than 200 different viruses that can cause the common cold. The most common viruses that cause common colds are rhinoviruses and different types of coronaviruses. COVID 19 is caused by a specific type of coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. The specific virus that causes infection and how your body’s immune system responds to the virus determines the symptoms and severity of illness. 

The main way that these viruses spread from person to person are through the tiny droplets that sick people propel when they cough, sneeze, or talk. These droplets can fly six feet or more in the air, and they can spread the virus if they deposit on someone’s mouth or nose or they get inhaled into a person’s lungs. The novel coronavirus, meaning SARS-CoV-2, is also aerosolized and can travel up to 27 feet in the aerosolized form. That something I talk more about in a separate video Colborne transmission. With COVID 19, an infected person doesn’t need to show symptoms to spread the virus. 

About 40% of viral transmission happens before infected people show symptoms. After people are infected, if they do develop symptoms, it can be for several days or for the duration of their illness. And about 1/3rd of people with COVID 19 never develop symptoms. You're contagious with the common cold the entire time you have symptoms, but you’re most contagious right after you catch the infection before you have symptoms. With the flu, you’re most contagious from the day before your symptoms start until about the fifth day of symptoms. 

It’s important to stay home with any of these illnesses when you or your child is most infectious. Viruses also spread through physical contact like kissing or shaking hands, or when a person touches a surface (like a desk or doorknob) that has accumulated droplets from a sick person and then touches his or her own eyes, mouth, or nose. Viruses can live on surfaces for hours to days, although how long they remain intact and infectious depends on the virus, the surface, and the environment. 

COVID 19 is a real wild card here. There can be no symptoms, or it can be similar to the common cold. Or it can be similar to the flu. But it can also cause loss of smell, so that is somewhat of a unique symptom. And it becomes concerning when people develop shortness of breath, which is a result of pneumonia developing. So although both flu and COVID 19 can cause pneumonia, COVID is more likely to do so. 
With COVID, it can take anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure to the virus for symptoms to appear. On average, it's 5 days. And that is if people do develop symptoms. Another unique aspect of COVID is that symptoms can start out mild or even improve temporarily and worsen. Some people continue to have fatigue and other symptoms for months after their infection, the so-called “long haulers.”

Why do some people get so sick with COVID? With COVID, the death rate ranges from 10% to 27% in people ages 85 and older but is less than 1% in those ages 54 and younger. One reason for this disparity may be differences in the aging immune system. 
Besides age, we know that there are other risk factors for more severe illness, like being male and having certain medical conditions like obesity, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and tobacco use. In a recent October study published in NEJM, researchers identified a specific cluster of genes that make some people more prone to have severe COVID illness. They also confirmed a potential involvement of the ABO blood-group system. There seems to be a higher risk in Type A than in other blood groups and a protective effect in Type O.

nqNxSRcIQPY,Doctor Mike Hansen,UCMSsLqxqvZsNXi0Z-VjN89A,1605713968.0,How Doctors Can Predict Who Dies From COVID,"How doctors can predict which patients are more likely to die of COVID

There are a number of studies that have come out about COVID 19 prognosis. We now have a powerful way to predict which patients with COVID 19 pneumonia are more likely to die, and more likely to require longer stays in the hospital. 

We already know that less than 15% of people who get COVID 19 have severe disease to the point of requiring hospitalization. Less than 5% of people who get coronavirus require ICU. For those with COVID 19 pneumonia who require ICU, and for some of the other patients in the hospital who might not necessarily need ICU, these are the patients who have the cytokine storm that we keep hearing about, meaning the immune system is going haywire, and there is a ton of inflammation taking place in the body….especially the lungs. But now, we have a more specific way of predicting who is more likely to develop cytokine storm, and therefore more likely to die, and who is more likely to require a longer stay in the hospital….and it's based on the bloodwork we get when patients are hospitalized.

When we get bloodwork, we’re doing various lab tests. Most commonly a complete blood count, or CBC, and a complete metabolic panel, or CMP. We often check other things as well, like troponin, d-dimer, LDH, ferritin, and CRP.  A complete blood count is specifically looking at 3 things: levels of hemoglobin, platelets, and white blood cells. We can see not only the total number of WBC, but also the breakdown of the percentages of the types of white blood cells, meaning, what percentage are neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.  Lymphocytes generally make up about 15-45% of WBC. This is very important as it pertains to COVID-19, and you’ll see why in a little bit. 

The CMP stands for the complete metabolic panel, and that is looking at levels of sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, calcium, bilirubin, albumin, and liver enzymes like AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase. Some of these also have important implications when it comes to COVID 19 disease severity. Because In the recent study done at Temple University, they analyzed over 500 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, all of which had inflammation in their lungs seen on CT scan of the chest (show). They determined the criteria for COVID 19 cytokine storm. For patients who met these criteria, their length of stay in the hospital was on average 15 days, compared to 6 days if they did not meet the criteria. 

Mortality was 28.8% in the group that met criteria, vs 6.6% in those who did not meet criteria. So if they met cytokine storm criteria, their likelihood of dying was 4 times higher. And how accurate was this prediction model? Pretty accurate, as this study had a specificity of 79% and a sensitivity of 85%, which is a lot of predictive power. Most of the patients who met the criteria for CS did so at the time of admission or shortly after. This suggests that there is an early and rapid progression in these patients, and also suggests that there is a low likelihood of developing cytokine storm after 10 days of hospitalization. 

So based on these specific lab parameters, this is how doctors can predict which patients are more likely to die of COVID-19. And I do find that this study correlates with what I’ve seen in my personal experience with hospitalized covid patients. And yes, the man whose CT scan I showed you earlier in this video, met all of these criteria for cytokine storm, and he did so as soon as 24 hours of being admitted to the hospital.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nqNxSRcIQPY/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-11 14:54:06.559233

Does colder temperature make you more prone to getting a cold Or COVID 19?
Most health experts agree that when it’s cold, people spend more time indoors and in close contact with other people, and this likely increases the spread of germs.
Also, experts believe that our immune system may be more active when our body is warmer, as in during the summer months.

Back in 2007, there was this study…
https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.0030151&type=printable

In this one particular study looking at the spread of the influenza virus, they put guinea pigs together in a chamber and carried out different environmental experiments on them. They found that low relative humidities of 20%–35% were most favorable for infection, while the transmission was completely blocked at high humidity of 80%.
They also found that when guinea pigs were kept at 5 °C, transmission occurred with greater frequency than at 20 °C, while at 30 °C, no transmission was detected.
The authors concluded that low relative humidities produced by indoor heating and cold
temperatures favored the spread of the influenza virus.

I also want to add, that cold weather, by itself, can cause a runny nose without necessarily
having a cold, and this allows for the virus so be carried in those secretions, which probably facilitates transmission.
40% of common colds are caused by rhinoviruses. The second most common cause of cold is the coronavirus, the normal one, not this novel coronavirus, aka SARS-CoV-2.
Its been shown that the rhinovirus reproduces more quickly at cooler temperatures means you might catch a cold more quickly if you’re chilly.

And this probably applies to the coronavirus as well.

It's likely that with the combination of all of these 5 factors, meaning, cooler temp, lower humidity, people staying indoors more often in winter months, cold weather causing runny noses and our immune system is more active when it's warmer, these combinations of factors likely explain why colds, flu, and COVID 19 are more likely to cause infections in the winter months.
But there is likely a 6th factor as well. And that is vitamin D. Our bodies don’t normally make vitamin D unless we get sunlight. In the winter months, for most of us in this world, we don’t get enough sunlight to make enough vitamin D. Unless you live in a warm climate, then maybe you are the exception. So if you aren’t getting enough sunlight in the winter months, that means you have to get enough vitamin D in your diet. And if you don’t do that, you will have low vitamin D levels. Vitamin D helps regulate or Calcium levels and is important for bone and muscle health. It also plays a role in regulating our immune system, but its exact role is not known.

Why is this important when it comes to the common cold, flu, and perhaps with this novel the coronavirus that’s causing COVID 19? Well, vitamin D doesn’t affect these viruses themselves. Instead, it affects our immune systems.

So what is my recommendation for taking Vitamin D?
The best thing to do is check with your doctor to see if you might have low vitamin D, and if it is low, you’ll def need to get more vitamin D, especially during the winter months.

Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that is vital to the function of white blood cells that help to fight infections, and overall immune system health. Vitamin C is also important for iron absorption, and being deficient in iron can make you more vulnerable to infections in general.
The normal, recommended daily intake of vitamin C for adults from the diet and/or supplements is 75 to 120 mg. You can get about 80 to 90 mg from a cup of orange juice or sliced orange, or even more from kiwi fruit, or a cup of sweet peppers.

Zinc has become one of the most popular suggestions for reducing symptoms of COVID.
Some studies showed that zinc reduces the duration of a cold by half, while others showed no effect. Another study found that the type of zinc taken determined the result—zinc gluconate lozenges that provided 13.3 milligrams (mg) of zinc lessened the duration of colds, but zinc acetate lozenges that provided 5 mg or 11.5 mg of zinc did not.

Generally, there are two types of operations for hernia.

Open hernia - The doctor makes an incision in the groin area and pushes the bulging tissue into the abdomen. The surgeon stitches the weak area, mostly with a synthetic mesh. After this is done, the surgeon closes the opening using a surgical glue or stitches it. This is the conventional process of surgery and the patient might require 3-5 weeks to completely recover.

Laparoscopic surgery - The doctor makes very small cuts in the abdomen. In this process, the doctor inserts a tiny camera called a laparoscope through the minute incision. Using the camera, the doctor diagnoses a hernia better and repairs it using synthetic mesh. This process is not painful and requires a much shorter time for the person to recover.

The best hernia repair treatments are painless and performed when the patient is under anesthesia. A patient can go home the next day and recover to the fullest in less than a week after laparoscopic hernia repair.


Advantages of laparoscopic treatment

Few things in medicine are more incredible than the birth of a baby.  Roughly 33% percent of pregnant women now give birth through a caesarean section rather than natural birth.  Known as a ""c-section"" this procedure involves removing the baby from the mother's abdomen when a natural birth may endanger the health of the mother or baby. During this interactive surgery, you will learn about the reasons why a c-section may be the preferred option for delivery, the steps taking to deliver a baby via c-section, and the specifics of recovery after c-section.

Asthma is a lung disease that inflames and narrows your airways. Normally, as you inhale, air moves freely through your trachea, or windpipe, then through large tubes, called bronchi, smaller tubes, called the bronchioles, and finally into tiny sacs, called alveoli. Small blood vessels, called capillaries, surround your alveoli. 

Oxygen from the air you breathe passes into your capillaries. Then carbon dioxide from your body passes out of your capillaries into your alveoli, so that your lungs can get rid of it when you exhale. Your bronchioles expand when the air is warm, moist, and free of irritants and allergy-causing substances, called allergens. When air is cold or dry, or contains irritants or allergens, your bronchioles contract. If you have asthma, your airways are frequently inflamed and swollen. 

Certain substances can cause your inflamed airways to overreact even more, resulting in an asthma attack. Triggers of asthma attacks are slightly different for everyone, but usually include outdoor irritants and allergens such as pollen, smoke, pollution, and cold weather. Indoor irritants and allergens such as mold, pet dander, dust mites, and cockroach droppings. Food allergens such as fish, shellfish, eggs, peanuts, and soy. And conditions such as respiratory infections, stress, strong emotions, and exercise. 

The symptoms of an asthma attack include coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and tightness in your chest. During an asthma attack, also known as a bronchospasm, the muscles around your airways tighten, and the airway wall becomes more swollen. Your airways also produce thick mucus that narrows them even more, making it hard for you to breathe. 

If you have asthma, your doctor may prescribe medications to reduce inflammation in your airways, constriction of the muscles surrounding your airways, or mucus secretion in your airways. During an asthma attack, you may need to use a short-acting rescue medication, called a bronchodilator. This medication causes your airway muscles to relax quickly, and provides symptom relief within minutes. 

Since there is no cure for asthma, the goal is to prevent you from having asthma attacks by using long-acting, anti-inflammatory control medications. If you take them every day, they will reduce the inflammation of your airways, making them less sensitive to triggers of asthma attacks.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4aK76DoxKGk/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-11 14:54:07.487920

Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ 

SUMMARY:
- When you sit in an office chair or on a couch, you compress your spine, especially closer to the bottom of your back. This compression causes stress on your muscles and nerves, causing aches in your lower back. 
- The pelvic tilt engages your abdominal muscles, which is really important when relieving lower back pain. The stronger your core muscles are, the better they are at supporting your spine and keeping it strong, making it less likely to feel stress as it compresses in your everyday life.
- This lumbar extension press is particularly effective for people who suffer from disc herniation, which is often caused by excessive sitting. It stretches out the lower back in a direction that you can’t necessarily do standing up and can provide great relief to your lumbar spine.
- Behind-the-back neck stretch is wonderful for relieving tension in the sides of your neck as well as your upper back. If it’s hard for you to do at first, don’t be discouraged! You just have to work on your flexibility. Try doing this move every day.
- The seated heart opener gives your neck a front stretch, which a lot of neck stretches fail to do. It should extend your neck’s flexibility a bit so that it doesn’t feel as tense throughout the day.

WHAT ARE MUSCLE KNOTS?

Muscle knots are hard, sensitive areas in our muscles where the muscle is in a shortened, contracted state even when the muscle is supposed to be at rest.

These muscle knots are commonly found in our neck, shoulders, upper back, and hips and are a common condition that affect millions of people everyday.

These tight areas of contracted muscle are also referred to as ""trigger points"" as oftentimes touching these areas can ""trigger"" pain in different location in your body.

Muscle knots can cause a painful, aching sensation in the muscle that can refer to nearby joints as well. When you touch it it feels tight and contracted despite your efforts to relax that area.

Muscle knots can also feel swollen and inflamed and can contribute to other associated problems including headaches, stress, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping.

Muscle knots are a common condition that I see in patients in my physical therapy clinic all the time. Fortunately there's a lot that you can do about them to treat them safely and effectively right at home!

Today I wanted to share some of my favorite tips, tricks, and exercises to help you get rid of muscle knots in your neck, shoulders, and upper back. I've also included video demonstration of each of these methods to ensure you do them correctly and maximize your outcomes.

HOW TO TREAT MUSCLE KNOTS

Keep in mind that treating your muscle knots can take some time. You didn't develop them overnight; chances are they're not going to go away overnight, also.

To treat your muscle knots you'll need to break up the knotted tissue and calm down the inflamed nerves.

Below you'll find a list of the most effective methods to alleviate your muscle knots at home.

1. Heat: applying heat to an area causes capillaries to dilate, thereby promoting more blood flow into that area. Increasing blood flow to a muscle can be an effective means of getting knots to release.

2. Stretching: muscle knots are areas of the muscle that fail to fully relax/elongate. Stretching the muscles in which these knots lie is an effective way to stretch out the knot, 

3. Muscle Activation: by working the muscle in which your knot lies you can increase blood flow into that spot and promote relaxation. Contracting these muscles is also a good way to fatigue this area and get the muscle knot to release.

4. Postural Correction: poor posture is one of the primary contributing factors predisposing one to muscle knots. Taking actions to correct poor posture and promote improved alignment can significantly improve muscle tension and pain.

5. Postural Strengthening and Muscle Activation: Stretching the tight structures through the front of the chest and shoulders while strengthening the weak muscles of your upper back in between your shoulder blades is key in improving posture and decreasing propensity for muscle knots.

NO-EQUIPMENT BACK WORKOUT: https://youtu.be/nfsQW1uGoBg

6. Massage: massaging muscle tissue is a great way to decrease tension and ""break up"" those chronic muscle contractions. We decrease tension and promote blood flow into an area when we massage it, so massage is great at alleviating muscle knots and associated pain.

7. Trigger Point Release: Trigger point release is applying a deep pressure directly on a muscle knot and maintaining that pressure 15-60 seconds. The theory here is that we actually compress capillaries and ""starve"" the knot of blood and oxygen. After the muscle fibers ""release"" we then release our pressure and blood/oxygen comes rushing back into the spot, thereby maintaining the relaxed state.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9PC9Mn0VO00/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-11 14:54:07.818107

As a physical therapist, I treat many posture related problems.

The thing is – people don’t come in to my clinic complaining of “bad posture“. People come into my clinic complaining of the symptoms that are typically associated with bad posture. Neck pain, knots in your upper shoulders, headache pain, etc. are typically related to poor posture.

These are the complaints for which people typically seek Physical Therapy help; little do these patients know how many of them wouldn’t be in any pain if they just spent some time addressing their posture!

Today on Tone and Tighten I wanted to discuss these postural issues – specifically what is poor posture, why you developed it, and some simple exercises you can do to correct this problem.

What is it?

Poor posture is typically characterized by what we refer to as a “forward head and rounded shoulders“ posture. When you stand up straight and tall, if I were to look at your profile from the side your ear should be directly located over the tip of your shoulder. Your sternum/chest should be pointed up with your shoulder blades sent back. This is what “good“ posture looks like.

In this position, gravity holds your head squarely on top your neck with very minimal muscle activation required. This results in minimal tension, decreased muscle knots, and decreased muscle activation.

Now let’s take a look at the implications of bad posture…

Again, bad posture is typically characterized by a “forward head and rounded shoulders“. Forward head refers to the position of your head relative to your shoulders. It simply means that if I were to look at your standing posture from the profile view your ear would be out in front of the tip of your shoulder.

This typically causes a “rounding“ forward of the shoulder blades and an increased visible “hump“ in the upper back.

In this position, your head is not in an ideal anatomical location. Gravity would cause it to flop forward if not for some muscle activation to hold it up. So to prevent your head from flopping forward you must activate the muscles in your neck and upper shoulders.

15–30 minutes at a time this might be OK, but when you spend 8 – 12 – 16 hours in this position, those muscles can get extremely fatigued.

The result is increased tension in your neck, pain with movement, stiffness, knots in your upper shoulders, and even headaches.

So what do we do about it?

The muscles in your body are highly adaptable to stresses placed on them or removed from them.

Our forward head and rounded shoulders posture typically results in what we refer to as an “upper cross syndrome“. The muscles through the front of your chest and back of your neck get tight while the muscles through your upper back and front of your neck get stretched out and week.

The treatment for this poor posture issue is to basically reverse our “upper cross syndrome“. We need to stretch where it’s tight (upper chest, front of the shoulders, and neck) and strengthen where it’s weak (rhomboids and middle traps – between your shoulder blades).

Here are 5 of my favorite exercises to help you overcome these problems. Push “Play” on the video above for a detailed description of the principles discussed in this post including an explanation of the following exercises.

Remember – oftentimes you don’t feel “poor posture”… but you certainly feel the effects from it. If you carry a large amount of tension in your neck and shoulders, get neck pain regularly, or experience tension headaches – your posture certainly could be playing a role in that.

Performing these exercises regularly will help to improve your posture. In fact many of my patients notice a significant improvement in about a month; it might be up to 3 months to see a remarkable improvement (it took your body a long time to develop poor posture; it’s going to take some time and effort to reverse this problem). You have to be diligent and consistent, but I know these can help you out!",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5R54QoUbbow/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-11 14:54:07.818107

You can put your hand under the curve of your back, and try to push your back into your hand. Make sure you are breathing and not holding your breath while doing these exercises.

Next you will do a bridge. Push your bottom up off the ground, but try to do this slowly, and do one segment of your back at a time curling upward. Then slowly go down the same way, one segment at a time.

Now you will do a single knee to chest stretch, bend one knee and bring your leg up to your chest as far as you comfortably can. Hold this for 30 seconds and do it three times on each side. Next, bring both knees to your chest, and hold it for 30 seconds doing it three times. This is called a double knee to chest stretch.

Then try some gentle trunk rotation stretches on your back with your knees bent in hooklying. Gently rotate your bent legs from side to side. You can hold them on each side for 3-5 seconds or you can continuously rotate them back and forth. Again, try to keep your lower back on the ground. You can start off with 10 and work your way up to 20-25.

The next stretch is the prayer stretch. Bring your butt back onto your heels, and keep your arms straight out. Relax your head down to the ground. Hold it for 30 seconds, and do it three times.

Finally, you will do a combination move where you start in a plank position, and go into an upward dog yoga position. Hold that for 3-5 seconds, and then make a smooth transition into a downward dog position. You can go through this motion 3-5 times.

==========================================

(Below we'll discuss sciatic nerve pain as related to the most common cause - a bulged or herniated disc. If your sciatica is coming from a different source, this may not be the best exercise progression for you. You're encouraged to consult with your doctor or physical therapist for an individualized treatment plan.)

As a doctor of physical therapy, spine injuries are the most common condition that I treat.

It seems like at one time or another low back pain or neck pain inflicts all of us. To a degree, almost all of us will experience some degree of low back or neck pain.

Depending on the cause of your low back pain, you may experience the accompanying symptom of sciatica. This  is characterized by pain/numbness/tingling down the back of your leg. It can travel to your glute, hamstring, or (in more severe cases) down into your calf and ankle.

Today I wanted to share with you the best exercises for treating sciatic nerve pain. This method of treatment is it clinically proven and backed by dozens of research studies to be the most effective exercise treatment for a common cause of sciatic nerve pain.

PHASE ONE: LAYING PRONE ON YOUR STOMACH
The simplest way to promote extension through your spine is to lay down prone on your stomach. This will create a natural curve to your back and vertebrae which will push the disc in the right direction. Gravity also works on the disc in this position to draw it closer to the center.

I recommend people start here until they can lay in this position for 2–3 minutes. When this becomes comfortable and there is no increase in your sciatic nerve symptoms, progress to Phase 2. 

PHASE TWO: PRONE ON ELBOWS
Bring your elbows directly under your shoulders and lift your chest up off of the floor. Your hips/stomach should stay in contact with the floor. In this position we promote increased extension through your lower back and draw the disc a little more aggressively back in the place.

Hold this position on your elbows for about 10 seconds, then lower your chest back down to the floor for 10 seconds, then repeat. This prone on elbows extension activity should be repeated 10 times for 10-second holds two times a day.

When prone on elbows becomes comfortable and there is no increase in your leg symptoms, progressed to Phase 3.

PAHSE THREE: HALF PRONE PRESS UPS
Now bring your hands directly under your shoulders. Lift your chest up off of the floor by extending your elbows approximately halfway. Once again, your goal is to keep your stomach and pelvis in contact with the floor and promote extension through your lower back.

Hold this position for 10 seconds and then return to the full prone position with your chest on the floor. Rest 10 seconds and then repeat.

Perform 10 reps of 10 second-holds two times daily.

When Phase 3 becomes comfortable with no increase in symptoms in your legs or pain in your back, progress to Phase 4.

PHASE FOUR: FULL PRONE PRESS UPS
A full prone press up is performed in a similar manner to the half press-up; the difference now is that your goal is to fully extend your elbows. Try to keep your pelvis/stomach in contact with the floor as your extend your elbows fully and raise your shoulders as high as they can go.

Perform 10 reps of 10 second-holds two times daily.

When Phase 4 becomes comfortable with no increase in symptoms in your legs or pain in your back, progress to Phase 5.

PHASE FIVE: STANDING BACK BEND
The standing back bend is performed by leaning over as far as you can backwards from a standing position. This is a little more aggressive than those I previously showed because it is in a weight-bearing posture and you do have to engage some muscles to keep from falling over. However, this is a great exercise to work some of your disc material back into place and minimize those sciatic nerve symptoms.

Try holding this position for 5 seconds, come forward for 5 seconds, and then repeat that 10 times.

Properly treating sciatic pain with the right exercises at the right time can be a very effective, non-invasive form of treatment for these symptoms.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fDkw-Zi5MBg/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-11 14:54:07.818107

✅ DO THIS EVERY MORNING! 5-MINUTE MOBILITY FOLLOW-ALONG ROUTINE: https://youtu.be/8abmMQe_Fpo 

Mobility is one of the critical components to our overall wellness. In order to maintain normal, pain-free function and movement, we have to be mindful of our flexibility and mobility - especially in our spines (collectively the most mobile part of our body).

Our muscles and joints undergo what we call “adaptive shortening” and “adaptive lengthening” based on the stresses (or lack thereof) placed upon an area. 

Basically - our bodies and joints operate under a “use it or lose it” principle. If we don’t take our joints into their end ranges of available motion and if we stay fixed in one posture for an extended period of time, we start to lose our range of motion. This can result in feelings of tightness, stiffness, and even pain.

The best way to combat these effects is by regularly taking your joints into ranges that they should go into and that they’re capable of going into, but don’t get there regularly. 

That’s where these exercises come in. This is a collection of the best exercises to stretch key muscles and joints into their end ranges of motion to increase your mobility and promote normal pain-free movement.

Click on the time stamps below to be taken directly to each exercise in the video. 

1. CHIN TUCKS (3:38) - My go-to exercise to decrease pain, tension, and even headaches in your cervical spine (neck). This is a must if you spend long periods of time in a “forward head posture” (working at a laptop, looking at a tablet or phone, etc).

2. NECK AND UPPER BACK EXTENSION STRETCHES (4:40) - Think about it - we rarely look up! Our whole lives are in front of us and we spend a lot of time looking straight or down. But our necks and our upper backs are designed to extend - to look up and move backwards. One of the best things you can do for your neck and upper back is to improve extension mobility.

CORRECT YOUR UPPER BACK AND NECK POSTURE NOW: https://youtu.be/5R54QoUbbow 

3. DOORWAY STRETCHES (6:54) - When we slump, our head comes forward on our necks and our shoulders round forward and in. To break out of this posture we need adequate range of motion through the front of the chest and shoulders. This is my go-to stretch to target those area.

4. LOWER BACK EXTENSION STRETCH (8:44) - We spend a lot of time sitting and many of our daily motions involve forward bending. Rarely do we extend our spines back the other direction in an effort to stretch them out. That’s where this stretch comes in.

*Don’t do this one if you have certain specific spine conditions.  If you’re dealing with back pain from things  like stenosis, degenerative disc disease, or spondylolisthesis, please do not perform these extension exercises. You need to promote spine flexion (bending forward) to stretch your back out safely.

BEST EXERCISES FOR DISC BULGE AND SCIATICA: https://youtu.be/fDkw-Zi5MBg 

5. HIP FLEXOR STRETCH (10:40) - we spend a lot of time sitting. Over time our hip flexors can adapt and shorten in this position. The unfortunate part about this is one of your hip flexor muscles attaches to your lower back vertebrae. If your hip flexors are tight they can pull on these vertebrae and pull your back forward and out of proper alignment.

HIP FLEXOR PAIN? YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS ONE: https://youtu.be/zTPfzlZbtz8 

6. HAMSTRINGS STRETCH (12:13) - Probably the one area/muscle group that most of us could use a little work on - our hamstrings are an area that are prone to becoming tight. They also have a connection on the pelvis and can contribute to lower back pain if not stretched out properly.

Causes of piriformis syndrome: 4:17
Stretches and exercises for piriformis syndrome: 6:19
============================================

Sciatica is irritation of the sciatic nerve. The most-common causes of sciatica that I see in my physical therapy clinic are a bulged/herniated lumbar disc, degenerative disc disease (DDD) and stenosis, and pirifomis syndrome (tightness/pain in the piriformis muscle).

Your piriformis is a muscle that that moves your hip. It originates on the outer edge of your tailbone and inserts over onto the outside part of the hip (the greater trochanter). Your sciatic nerve exits out of your spinal column and passes beneath this muscle. If the piriformis is tight or irritated it can put stress on the sciatic nerve and cause sciatica symptoms.

Common causes of piriformis syndrome and concomitant sciatica include sitting for long periods of time, increased pressure on the piriformis muscle (sitting on a wallet, sitting with your legs crossed), and piriformis muscle weakness.

In order to alleviate sciatica caused by piriformis syndrome, your treatment approach must include three key elements. They are massaging this area, stretching the muscle, and strengthening the muscle. Each one of these individually can offer you some relief to a degree; however healing will be faster and more complete if you incorporate all three methods.

MASSAGE (6:25): promotes tissue relaxation and fascial release to help the muscle move a little better. The best ways to massage the piriformis include a foam roller and/or a tennis ball.

STRETCHING (9:25): another great way to decrease tension in the piriformis. In this video I take you through a progression of stretches to help alleviate tension in the tight piriformis.

STRENGTHENING (13:20): oftentimes piriformis weakness can be a cause of piriformis syndrome. Contracting this muscle promotes blood flow into the area and can serve to “reset” the muscle if it’s in spasm. The best home exercises to strengthen your piriformis include clamshells and fire hydrants (quadruped external rotation).

Piriformis syndrome is a common cause of sciatica pain. Performing the techniques demonstrated in this video can help you Please see my video above for detailed demonstration on how to alleviate your sciatica caused by piriformis syndrome.

Be sure to leave your comments below and share with your friends who you think would benefit from this information!

The most-common cause of shoulder pain that I treat in my physical therapy clinic is a condition known as “impingement”.

Your shoulder is a ball and socket joint. That “ball” should stay firmly seated in that “socket” during shoulder motions, especially overhead. If the head of the humerus (the ball) does not stay seated properly in the glenoid cavity (the socket) during motion it can “pinch” on the tendon and other structures up on the top of your shoulder.

Over time, this can lead to pain, inflammation, and even a rotator cuff tear. It’s important that you address the cause of this pain quickly to avoid exacerbating the injury.

The primary causes of shoulder impingement include poor posture, muscle weakness, joint tightness, and muscle imbalance. The most effective way to cure this impingement syndrome is to perform exercises that address these deficits.

Posture is probably the number one cause of shoulder impingement. To demonstrate why this is an issue I want you to stand up and slump forward (exaggerate poor posture). Now try to reach your hands all the way over your head. You won’t be able to do it! You’ll get to about 160 degrees of motion and run into a block.

That’s the impingement I’m talking about. You’re pinching those structures under the roof of your socket and it’s not allowing you to go any further.

Now stand with great posture. Tuck your shoulder blades down and back and make sure your head is squarely over your shoulders. Now reach both arms up in over your head. You should find that you are able to reach a lot higher with a lot less pain.

In order to achieve full overhead motion, your shoulder blade needs to upwardly rotate. This will enable you to achieve those last 20° of motion without pain.

This is why posture is important when we talk about shoulder pain and range of motion.

The second primary cause of shoulder impingement that I see in my clinic is rotator cuff weakness. You have 4 muscles that make up the “rotator cuff”. The primary function of the rotator cuff is to keep the head of the humerus (ball) seated squarely in the middle socket of the shoulder.

Oftentimes muscle imbalance and shoulder/rotator cuff weakness can cause the head of the humerus to move towards the front of the shoulder. During overhead motions, there’s less room under the “roof” in the front of the shoulder than there is in the middle of the shoulder. This can cause shoulder pain and impingement during overhead motions.

SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT?

The best things you can do to eliminate shoulder impingement are to stretch the tight structures in the front of the shoulder and chest while strengthening the rotator cuff muscles in the back. This will promote a better anatomical position for the shoulder joint and enable you to move through these overhead motions with decreased pain and less “pinching” symptoms.

The stretches and exercises that I recommend to patients experiencing this type of shoulder pain include:

1. Doorway Stretches (Low, Middle, and High): great stretch for the front of the chest and shoulders. I like the low position for the pull through the biceps tendon and I like the high position for the additional rotation component.

2. Foam Roller: lay on a 36” foam roller to stretch your chest and shoulders out. If you need to get one you can do so at this link: https://amzn.to/2Wepsmp

3. Scapula Pinches: One of my favorite exercises to correct poor posture and help put your shoulder blades back in the correct position for function.

4. YTA: Easy shoulder and rotator cuff exercises you can do at home with zero equipment required.

5. Resisted External/Internal Rotation: My personal go-to exercises for rotator cuff strengthening. Remember while internal rotation will be strong, functionally speaking external rotation will be more important.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Aq6RMo7RJ9c/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-11 14:54:07.818107

QcWELyTbdP4,ChrisFix,UCes1EvRjcKU4sY_UEavndBw,1547734115.0,How to Replace a Clutch in your Car or Truck (Full DIY Guide),"Learn how to replace a clutch, flywheel, pressure plate, throw out bearing (aka release bearing), pilot bearing and rear main seal in this video!

My clutch was fine but my throwout bearing was bad so I decided to show how to replace all of the wear items while the transmission was off. This includes replacing the pilot bearing which the transmission input shaft goes into, the throwout bearing which engages the pressure plate via the clutch fork, the flywheel which I upgraded to an aluminum light weight flywheel, and finally the rear main seal because that is a common wear item which causes oil leaks in higher mileage motors. With the transmission out, it is worth it to replace all of these parts now instead of having to do this all over again. Most clutch kits come with the throwout bearing and pilot bearing so you just need to buy a rear main seal.

The driving is effortless because you don’t need to worry about gear changing and you don’t have a clutch pedal to operate. In an automatic transmission car the work, of the clutch pedal, is automatically done by a hidden component, which is truly an engineering marvel, the torque converter. The torque converter can even multiply the torque. Let’s see how this purely mechanical device performs its tasks.

View full lesson: http://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-sugar-affects-the-brain-nicole-avena

When you eat something loaded with sugar, your taste buds, your gut and your brain all take notice. This activation of your reward system is not unlike how bodies process addictive substances such as alcohol or nicotine -- an overload of sugar spikes dopamine levels and leaves you craving more. Nicole Avena explains why sweets and treats should be enjoyed in moderation.

We have over 600 muscles in our bodies that help bind us together, hold us up, and help us move.

--

Nobody knows exactly when humans began to create fermented beverages. The earliest known evidence comes from 7,000 BCE in China, where residue in clay pots has revealed that people were making an alcoholic beverage from fermented rice, millet, grapes, and honey. So how did alcohol come to fuel global trade and exploration? Rod Phillips explores the evolution of alcohol.

Mia Nacamulli details the three types of bilingual brains and shows how knowing more than one language keeps your brain healthy, complex and actively engaged.

u_1sVri3b2w,Tech Insider,UCVLZmDKeT-mV4H3ToYXIFYg,1521492188.0,Here's What Happens In Your Body When You Swallow Gum | The Human Body,"We have all heard of terrible things that take place inside our stomach when we swallow gum. But is it really that big of a deal if you forget to spit it out?

You may have heard from your 2nd grade teacher that if you swallow your gum, it could stay in your stomach forever. Or worse, it could grow into a rubber tree. Well, that's true. Don't do it.

Just kidding. Swallowing chewing gum isn't really going to plant trees in your stomach, but that's no reason to start doing it regularly. Here's what happens to your body when you swallow gum.

When you eat standard food, three processes go to work in your body to turn food into fuel. The first is obvious: Chewing.

The process breaks food into smaller and smaller pieces, increasing the surface area.

Meanwhile, saliva coats those pieces, delivering enzymes that help break down the food.

Finally, once swallowed, the stomach acids turn any remaining food pieces into mush. This lets the food pass through the rest of the digestive tract smoothly.

But gum doesn't play by those rules. As much as you chew it, gum doesn't break up into smaller pieces.

Because it's gum. Duh.

Gum has been around for much longer than you'd think. Ancient Mayans and Aztecs harvested resin from the Sapodilla tree. They would dry it into a 'cha', and chewed it to stave off hunger. Even back then, it was also recognized as a breath freshener.

However, most gum today is made from natural or synthetic polymers, most commonly butyl rubber.

It’s used in all kinds of products, including adhesives, fiber optics, sealants, cling film, paper, fuel, explosives, sporting equipment, roofing, bottle stoppers, and tires.

But don't worry, the butyl in gum won't make you sick.

Because it can't be broken down, the wad of chewed gum hits your stomach intact.  

Your saliva enzymes and your stomach acid can't touch the butyl in the gum base. But that doesn't mean it just hangs out.

Your body is equipped to handle gum in the same way it deals with other food it can't fully digest, like corn and sunflower seeds.

The muscles of your digestive tract move it along and eventually flush it out of your system in a day or two, along with everything else.

So, no, your gum doesn't stay in your body when you swallow it. But that's no reason to start gulping it down by the pack. The more gum that your body has to process, the higher the likelihood that it'll build up.

This gum mass could potentially clog your digestive tract, causing an intestinal blockage which can trigger stomach pain or constipation.

There's a lovely name for this blockage: a bezoar. An 18-year old Israeli woman once suffered from a bezoar that blocked her stomach. The problem?

Turns out, she had been swallowing at least five pieces of gum every day.

The blockage had grown so large that doctors had to break it into smaller pieces and then fish it out of her, piece by piece.

But chewing gum alone isn't necessarily bad for you.

A couple small studies have shown that the act of chewing gum can actually help relax you. Because it can help reduce levels of cortisol — a common stress hormone — in your saliva.

So, feel free to unwrap a stick.You won't be alone. 56% of American chew gum, each about 280 sticks per year. It's a 2 billion dollar industry in the U.S.

But be wary of swallowing it once done. The occasional piece of gum won’t hurt, but with everything your body already does for you, why put it through the extra work? Just don't spit it out on the ground. That's just gross.

Blood supply of Heart /  Anatomy of Coronary arteries

The left and right coronary arteries arise from the root of the aorta and supply the heart muscle with arterial blood.

Dominance of circulation
-----------------------------------------
Right-dominant (∼ 85% of the population): posterior descending artery (PDA) supplied by the RCA
Left-dominant (∼ 8% of the population): PDA supplied by the left circumflex artery (LCX)
Codominant (balanced; ∼ 7% of people): PDA supplied by both RCA and LCX

Coronary blood flow peaks during early diastole at a point when the pressure differential between the aorta and the ventricle is the greatest.

Nebraska Medical Center cardiologist Dr. Haysam Akkad explains how a stent is place inside a blocked artery and what a patient is likely to feel after the procedure is finished. Doctors place the stent by threading a wire through an artery in the leg until the stent is at the point where the artery blocked or narrowed. A tiny balloon inside the stent then inflates. The stent, a tiny wire mesh tube the holds the artery open, allowing increased blood flow.

The heart is located in the center of the chest. It's job is to keep blood continually circulating throughout the body.

The blood vessels that supply the body with oxygen-rich blood are called arteries.
The arteries that supplies blood to the heart muscle itself are called coronary arteries.
Sometimes, these blood vessels can narrow or become blocked by plaque deposits, restricting normal blood flow.

In simple terms, a balloon angioplasty with stent insertion is a procedure used to increase the amount of blood flowing through the coronary artery.

During a balloon angioplasty, a heart specialist will insert a thin tube into an artery in your arm or leg and gently guide it towards the problem area in your heart.

Once the tube is in place, a small balloon is briefly inflated in order to widen the narrowed artery.

A short length of mesh tubing called a stent is then inserted into the newly widened artery.
During and after the procedure, your doctor will take x-rays in order to monitor your progress.

The cardiac conduction system consists of the following components:
- The sinoatrial node, or SA node, located in the right atrium near the entrance of the superior vena cava. This is the natural pacemaker of the heart. It initiates all heartbeat and determines heart rate. Electrical impulses from the SA node spread throughout both atria and stimulate them to contract. 
- The atrioventricular node, or AV node, located on the other side of the right atrium, near the AV valve. The AV node serves as electrical gateway to the ventricles. It delays the passage of electrical impulses to the ventricles. This delay is to ensure that the atria have ejected all the blood into the ventricles before the ventricles contract.  
- The AV node receives signals from the SA node and passes them onto the atrioventricular bundle -  AV bundle or bundle of His. 
- This bundle is then divided into right and left bundle branches which conduct the impulses toward the apex of the heart. The signals are then passed onto Purkinje (pur-KIN-jee) fibers, turning upward and spreading throughout the ventricular myocardium. 
Electrical activities of the heart can be recorded in the form of electrocardiogram, ECG or EKG. An ECG is a composite recording of all the action potentials produced by the nodes and the cells of the myocardium. Each wave or segment of the ECG corresponds to a certain event of the cardiac electrical cycle. 
When the atria are full of blood, the SA node fires, electrical signals spread throughout the atria and cause them to depolarize. This is represented by the P wave on the ECG. Atrial contraction , or atrial systole (SIS-toe-lee) starts about 100 mili-seconds after the P wave begins. 
The P-Q segment represents the time the signals travel from the SA node to the AV node.  
The QRS complex marks the firing of the AV node and represents ventricular depolarization: 
- Q wave corresponds to depolarization of the interventricular septum. 
- R wave is produced by depolarization of the main mass of the ventricles. 
- S wave represents the last phase of ventricular depolarization at the base of the heart.
- Atrial repolarization also occurs during this time but the signal is obscured by the large QRS complex.
The S-T segment reflects the plateau in the myocardial action potential.  This is when the ventricles contract and pump blood. 
The T wave represents ventricular repolarization immediately before ventricular relaxation, or ventricular diastole (dy-ASS-toe-lee). 
The cycle repeats itself with every heartbeat.

This video, created by Nucleus Medical Media, shows a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure used to combat coronary artery disease. Beginning with a midline sternal incision, the heart is connected to a perfusion machine which will take over the duties of the heart while the surgery takes place. Two different grafts are used to bypass the blocked coronary arteries: the internal thoracic artery from inside the chest wall, and the saphenous vein from the leg. After the procedure, the heart is shocked to restart its beating. A drainage tube is left at the incision site to drain away excess fluid.  The animation continues to show two other types of approaches to a coronary artery bypass graft, off-pump bypass surgery and minimally invasive bypass surgery.

This is similar to the procedure performed on former president Bill Clinton and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Heart failures can be due to an inability to PUMP effectively during systole - SYSTOLIC heart failure, or inability to FILL properly during diastole - DIASTOLIC heart failure.
Heart failure can be right-sided or left-sided .
In systolic heart failure, ventricular contraction is compromised. This may be caused by any condition that weakens the heart muscle:
- Coronary artery disease/Ischemic HD: 
- Dilated cardiomyopathy
- Hypertension: 
- Valvular heart disease: Damage to the valves, such as stenosis
The effectiveness of ventricular contraction is measured by the EJECTION fraction. The normal range of the ejection fraction is between 50 and 70%. In systolic heart failure, it drops below 40%.
In DIASTOLIC heart failure, the ventricle is filled with LESS blood. This may be because it is smaller than usual, or it has lost the ability to relax. The ejection fraction may be normal, but the blood output is reduced. The ejection fraction is therefore commonly used to differentiate between SYSTOLIC and DIASTOLIC dysfunction.
Examples of conditions that can lead to diastolic heart failure include:
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- Restrictive cardiomyopathy: 
- Hypertension  
Regardless of being systolic or diastolic in nature, left-sided heart failures share a common outcome: LESS blood pumped out from the heart. As a result, blood flows back to the lungs, where it came from, causing CONGESTION and INCREASED pulmonary pressure. As this happens, fluid leaks from the blood vessels into the lung tissue, resulting in PULMONARY EDEMA, a hallmark of left-sided heart failure. Accumulation of fluid in the alveoli IMPEDES the gas exchange process, resulting in respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, which worsens when lying down, and chest crackles. 
RIGHT-sided heart failure is most commonly caused by LEFT-sided heart failure. This is because the INCREASED pulmonary pressure caused by left-sided heart failure makes it harder for the right ventricle to pump INTO the pulmonary artery. This results in SYSTOLIC dysfunction. In compensation, the right ventricle grows thicker to pump harder, which reduces the space available for filling, eventually leading to DIASTOLIC dysfunction. Other common causes of right-sided heart failure include chronic lung diseases which also raise pulmonary blood pressure. 
As the right ventricle pumps out less blood, the blood, again, backs up to where it came from, and in this case, the SYSTEMIC circulation. This results in abnormal fluid accumulation in various organs, most notable in the feet when standing, sacral area when lying down, abdominal cavity and liver.  The fluid status can be assessed by examining the distension level of the jugular vein.
Heart failure is usually managed by treating the underlying condition, together with a combination of drugs. ACE inhibitors, beta blockers are used to reduce blood pressure in patients with systolic dysfunction. Diuretics are used to reduce water retention.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b3OHSA7Tz7U/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-12 12:54:36.657206
4xQVTVTjYhw,Nebraska Medicine Nebraska Medical Center,UCkC6cn6cXy_1eWD7ZlMAIuA,1333489567.0,Stent Implantation Coronary Angioplasty Nebraska Patient Education,"Your doctor has recommended that you undergo a balloon angioplasty with a stent implant. But what does that actually mean?

The heart is located in the center of the chest. It's job is to keep blood continually circulating throughout the body.

The blood vessels that supply the body with oxygen-rich blood are called arteries.
The arteries that supplies blood to the heart muscle itself are called coronary arteries.
Sometimes, these blood vessels can narrow or become blocked by plaque deposits, restricting normal blood flow.

In simple terms, a balloon angioplasty with stent insertion is a procedure used to increase the amount of blood flowing through the coronary artery.

During a balloon angioplasty, a heart specialist will insert a thin tube into an artery in your arm or leg and gently guide it towards the problem area in your heart.

Once the tube is in place, a small balloon is briefly inflated in order to widen the narrowed artery.

A short length of mesh tubing called a stent is then inserted into the newly widened artery.
During and after the procedure, your doctor will take x-rays in order to monitor your progress.

Ovulation is the part of the menstrual cycle where the ovary releases an egg to be fertilized during conception, or sloughed off during a woman's period.   This 3D medical animation depicts in exquisite detail: follicle development within the ovary, the movement of the fimbriae over the ovulation site before ovulation, the bursting of the egg from the ovary in a rush of fluid, delicate quality of the ciliated fimbriae and its movement to pick up the egg after ovulation, peristalsis of the fallopian tube to move the egg toward the uterus. Ovulation must take place in order for a woman to get pregnant, preceding the meeting of the male sperm during fertilization.

ANH09353

Transcript:

Ovulation is a part of the menstrual cycle when the ovary releases a ripe egg, or ovum.
Inside the ovary are hundreds of thousands of follicles. Each follicle is a hollow ball of cells with an immature egg in the center. 
The typical 28-day menstrual cycle begins on the first day of menstrual bleeding.
During the first 7 days of the cycle, a few follicles begin to grow at the same time.
These maturing follicles secrete estrogen hormone into the blood stream to prepare the lining of the uterus for pregnancy.
Around Day 7, all of the follicles stop growing and begin to degenerate except for one.
This dominant follicle continues to grow and nourishes the developing egg inside it.
Around Day 12, the follicle secretes a large amount of estrogen into the blood stream.
When the estrogen reaches the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland in the brain, the anterior or front part of the pituitary gland releases a huge surge of luteinizing hormone into the blood stream.
Around day 14, luteinizing hormone causes the follicle to undergo a sudden growth spurt.
Right before ovulation, the egg detaches from the inside of the follicle.
The bulging follicle releases chemicals, causing one of the two fallopian tubes to move in closer and surround the follicle.
The follicle swells until... it bursts open, ejecting the egg and fluid from the follicle into the abdominal cavity.
In response, the fimbriae, tiny projections at the end of the fallopian tube, sweep across the ovulation site and pick up the egg.
Microscopic cilia on the fimbriae's surface transport the egg to the entrance of the fallopian tube.
Inside the walls of the fallopian tube, muscular contractions gently push the egg toward the uterus.
After ovulation, the egg lives for 12-24 hours, so it must be fertilized by a sperm from the male during this time for a woman to become pregnant.
If it is not fertilized, the egg dissolves away and is shed along with the uterine lining during menstruation.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nLmg4wSHdxQ/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-12 12:54:38.203482

Epidemiologist David Barker says that whilst developing inside our mother, we are receiving ‘postcards’ from the outside world. These postcards tell us if this world is dangerous or safe if food is plentiful or scarce. Knowing nothing else, we learn from those messages.

This animation depicts the sequence of events in a delivery with several complications. A lateral cut-away view of the mother reveals her spine, pubic bones and the infant as delivery begins. We notice a nuchal cord (umbilical cord wrapped around the neck) on the infant. Meconium invades the amniotic fluid, prompting the physician to rupture the membranes, releasing most of the fluid. Maternal contractions fail to expel the infant. The process of fetal circulation is described. An enlargement of a segment of normal umbilical cord is compared to a segment of compressed umbilical cord to show the restriction of blood flow in the latter. The infant inhales some of the meconium stained fluid. A vacuum is applied to the head and suprapubic pressure is applied in an attempt at delivery, but the shoulder gets caught on the mother's pubic bones. The nuchal cord is freed from the infant's head. The shoulder is dislodged and the infant is delivered.

The place shown in this video no longer exists: on 22 Dec 2018, the summit cone of Anak Krakatau island, seen here erupting, collapsed into the sea in a massive landslide, triggering a devastating tsunami that killed hundreds of people.
Video was taken during a VolcanoDiscovery expedition to Krakatau from 13-20 Oct 2018. In the afternoon of 17 Oct, a particularly violent explosion occurred as lateral blast that excavated a pit crater beneath the southern lid of the crater, at the same location the September lava flow had overspilled from the crater. By 19 Oct, this new pit had merged with the main crater, enlarging it.

NGcbNn4Vk1w,Newsflare,UCzSSoloGEz10HALUAbYhngQ,1572530959.0,Incredible Krakatoa volcano eruptions at night | anak krakatau 2018,"Archive footage from 25th October 2018 showing Krakatau volcano erupting spectacularly in Indonesia.

A larger eruption some weeks later from the same volcano caused a tsunami which has killed more than 160 people.

Background information:
Krakatau, a small island group in the Sunda Strait between the islands of Sumatra and Java is one of the world's most famous volcanoes. It is a mostly submerged caldera with 3 outer islands belonging to the rim and a new cone, Anak Krakatau, that has been forming a new island since 1927 and remains highly active.
Krakatau exploded spectacularly in a devastating Plinian eruption 1883 that killed more than 30,000 people (mostly by the huge tsunamis triggered by the eruption). The eruption was one of the first global news events after telegraph lines had connected the different continents.

DEEP LOOK is a ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.

Pretty much every adult human alive has a population of these mites living on them.

Also called eyelash mites, they’re too small to see with the naked eye. They’re mostly transparent, and at about .3 millimeters long, it would take about five face adult mites laid end to end to stretch across the head of a pin.

Face mites spend their days face-down inside your hair follicles nestled up against the hair shaft.
They eat sebum, that greasy oil your skin makes to protect itself and keep it from drying out. That’s why the greasiest parts of your body — like around the eyes, nose and mouth — likely harbor a higher concentration of mites than other areas.

They live about two weeks. They spend most of their time tucked inside our pores. But while we’re sleeping, they crawl out onto the surface of our skin to mate before crawling back into our pores to lay their eggs. Fun!

--- How common are face mites?
Pretty much everyone has some face mites on them. Babies are born without them but quickly receive them from their parents through direct contact. The amount of mites may increase during puberty when the skin starts to produce more oil.

--- How do you get rid of face mites?
There’s usually no need to try to rid yourself of face mites as they typically don’t cause any symptoms and are nearly impossible to fully eradicate. Since female face mites can also reproduce asexually, it only takes one mite to repopulate your skin. Some people experience an overpopulation of face mites resulting in an inflammatory disease called demodicosis which is easy to recognize sue to the many small evenly-sized pimples that appear quickly. Consult a dermatologist if you think you may have symptoms.

--- What do face mites eat?

Face mites consume the greasy oil that you skin produces to protect itself.

With summer just around the corner, Southern California beaches are ready to welcome the yearly arrival of some very unique and amorous guests. That’s right, the grunion are running!
 
California grunion are fish that spend their lives in the ocean. But when the tides are at their highest during spring and summer, grunion make a trip up onto beaches to mate and lay eggs.
 
Grunion mate on beaches throughout southern California and down into into Mexico. The grunion runs have taken on a special importance to coastal communities Santa Barbara to San Diego. 
 
For some, coming out to see the grunion run has been an annual tradition for generations. For others it’s a rare chance to catch ocean fish with their bare hands.
 
--- What are grunion?
California grunion are schooling fish similar to sardines that live in the Pacific Ocean that emerge from the sea to lay their eggs on the sand of beaches in Southern California and down the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico. There are also smaller populations in Monterey Bay and San Francisco Bay. Another species, the Gulf Grunion lays their eggs in the northern shores of the Gulf of California. California Grunion are typically about six inches in length.
 
--- Why do grunion mate on land?
The ocean is full of predators who would like to gobble up a tasty fish egg. The grunion eggs tend to be safer up on the beach if they can make it there without raising the attention of predators like birds and raccoons. Grunion eggs have a tough outer layer that keeps them from drying out or being crushed by the sand. 
 
--- When do California grunion run?
California grunion typically spawn from March to August. The fishing season is closed during the peak spawning times during May and June. See https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/fishing/ocean/grunion#28352306-2017-runs for more detailed info on grunion seasons.

Flies are formidable opponents, with an arsenal of tools they carry all over their bodies. For starters, their hair and antennae help a fly sense us as we walk up to them. And a fly’s eyes and tiny brain process information 10 times faster than human eyes and brains. 

“Compared to flies, humans are slow and sluggish creatures,” said Sanjay Sane, who researches flies at the National Centre for Biological Sciences at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bangalore, India.

Once the fly escapes your swatter and is in the air, it’s in its element and your job is even tougher. Seen up close and slowed down, a fly’s aerobatics are impressive: It makes razor-sharp turns with ease and at great speed. 

What makes this possible is a pair of modified wings called halteres, a Greek word for dumbbell, which describes their shape. All of the 200,000 species of flies that scientists have described have a pair of halteres and a pair of wings. (That includes mosquitoes, which, wouldn’t you know it, are flies too). Most other insects – bees, butterflies, dragonflies – have four wings and no halteres.

--- How do flies’ halteres work?

As a fly turns, its halteres sense the rotation. In a split second, neurons at the base of the halteres send information to the fly’s muscles to steer its wings and keep its head steady.

“Houseflies flap their wings about 200 times per second, which means they really only have five milliseconds to figure out what the next wingbeat is going to be like. And if you’re using vision that takes too long to do,” said Jessica Fox, who studies flies at Case Western Reserve University, in Ohio. “They really need a mechanical receptor in order to be able to sense their body rotations and correct them on the timescale that they need.”

--- How do flies land and stay on the ceiling?

Their halteres allow them to rotate quickly to land on the ceiling. Once they’re there, they hang upside down with tiny hooks and sticky pads on their feet. The pads, called pulvilli, have microscopic hairs that excrete a liquid that sticks to the surface.

--- How do I swat a fly?
“Flies process information about moving objects but they cannot process static objects, Sane explained. “Thus, the best way to approach a fly is in small, quasi-static steps such that they do not see you as a moving object.”

A baby hairworm hitches a ride inside a cricket, feasting on its fat until the coiled-up parasite is ready to burst out. Then it hijacks the cricket's mind and compels it to head to water for a gruesome little swim.

If you’re out on a hike and look down at a puddle, you might spot a long, brown spaghetti-shaped creature whipping around madly in a figure 8. 

It’s a hairworm – also known as a horsehair worm or Gordian worm – and researchers have described 350 species around the world. Good news: It isn’t interested in infecting or attacking humans. But if you had happened on the puddle a few hours earlier, you might have witnessed a gruesome spectacle – the hairworm wriggling out of a cricket’s body, pushing its way out like the baby monster in the movie “Alien.”

How a hairworm ends up in a puddle, or another water source such as a stream, hot tub or a pet’s water dish, is a complex story. A young hairworm finds its way into a cricket or similar insect like a beetle or grasshopper, and once it’s grown into an adult, the parasite takes over its host’s brain to hitch a ride to the water. 

As a result of the infection, crickets stop growing and reproducing. Male crickets infected by hairworms even lose their chirp, said Ben Hanelt, a biologist at the University of New Mexico who studies hairworms.

--- What *is* a hair worm?
A hair worm or hairworm – pick your spelling – is a nematomorph. Nematomorpha are a group of parasites. They’re long, thin worms that can grow to be several meters long inside their host.

--- Can humans be infected by hair worms?
There are reports of humans and cats and dogs being infected by hair worms, but hair worms aren’t after us or our pets because they can’t grow inside us, said Hanelt. They can only grow inside a host like a cricket or a related insect.

“What happens is that a dog, a cat, a human will ingest an adult (hair worm) somehow,” said Hanelt. “Could a cricket crawl in your sandwich before you take a bite? I don’t know. None of the studies that are out there talk about that. What they have been reported to do is to cause in many people intestinal distress.”   

--- How do hair worms control crickets’ minds? 
Scientists don’t understand the precise mechanism yet, but they believe that hairworms either boost chemicals in the crickets’ brains or pump chemicals into their brains.

The same blood-sucking leeches feared by hikers and swimmers are making a comeback... in hospitals. Once used for questionable treatments, leeches now help doctors complete complex surgeries to reattach severed body parts.

Leeches get a bad rap—but they might not deserve it. Yes, they’re creepy crawly blood-suckers. And they can instill an almost primal sense of disgust and revulsion. Humphrey Bogart’s character in the 1951 film The African Queen even went so far as to call them “filthy little devils.”

But the humble leech is making a comeback. Contrary to the typical, derogatory definition of a human “leech,” this critter is increasingly playing a key role as a sidekick for scientists and doctors, simply by being its bloodthirsty self.

Distant cousins of the earthworm, most leech species are parasites that feed on the blood of animals and humans alike. They are often found in freshwater and navigate either by swimming or by inching themselves along, using two suckers—one at each end of their body—to anchor themselves.

Upon reaching an unsuspecting host, a leech will surreptitiously attach itself and begin to feed. It uses a triangular set of three teeth to cut in, and secretes a suite of chemicals to thin the blood and numb the skin so its presence goes undetected.

That caterpillar in your backyard is chewing through your best leaves for a good reason.

“Caterpillars have to store up incredible reserves of proteins,” said Carol Boggs, an ecologist at the University of South Carolina. “Nectar doesn’t have much protein. Most of the protein that goes to making eggs has to come from larval feeding.”

Caterpillars are the larval stage of a butterfly. Their complete transformation to pupa and then to butterfly is a strategy called holometaboly. Humans are in the minority among animals in that we don’t go through these very distinct, almost separate, lives. We start out as a smaller version of ourselves and grow bigger. 

But from an evolutionary point of view, the way butterflies transform make sense. 

“You have a larva that is an eating machine,” said Boggs. “It’s very well-suited to that. Then you’re turning it into a reproduction machine, the butterfly.”

Once it becomes a butterfly it will lose its mouth, grow a straw in its place and go on a liquid diet of sugary nectar and rotten fruit juices. Its main job will be to mate and lay eggs. Those eggs started to develop while it was a pupa, using protein that the caterpillar stored by gorging on leaves. We think of leaves as carbohydrates, but the nitrogen they contain makes them more than one quarter protein, said Boggs.

-- What are the stages of a butterfly?
Insects such as butterflies undergo a complete transformation, referred to by scientists as holometaboly. A holometabolous insect has a morphology in the juvenile state which is different from that in the adult and which undergoes a period of reorganization between the two, said Boggs. The four life stages are egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (also known as chrysalis) and butterfly.

-- What if humans developed like butterflies?
“We’d go into a quiescent period when we developed different kind of eating organs and sensory organs,” said Boggs. “It would be as if we went into a pupa and developed straws as mouths and developed more elaborate morphology for smelling and developed wings. It brings up science fiction images.”

Seen up close, the anatomy of a mosquito bite is terrifying. The most dangerous animal in the world uses six needle-like mouthparts to saw into our skin, tap a blood vessel and sometimes leave a dangerous parting gift.

Scientists have discovered that the mosquito’s mouth, called a proboscis isn’t just one tiny spear. It’s a sophisticated system of thin needles, each of which pierces the skin, finds blood vessels and makes it easy for mosquitoes to suck blood out of them. 

Male mosquitoes don’t bite us, but when a female mosquito pierces the skin, a flexible lip-like sheath called the labium scrolls up and stays outside as she pushes in six needle-like parts that scientists refer to as stylets. 

Two of these needles, called maxillae, have tiny teeth. The mosquito uses them to saw through the skin. They’re so sharp you can barely feel the mosquito biting you. 

“They’re like drill bits,” said University of California, Davis, biochemist Walter Leal.

Another set of needles, the mandibles, hold tissues apart while the mosquito works.

Then the sharp-tipped labrum needle probes under the skin, piercing a vessel and sucking blood from it. 

The sixth needle – called the hypopharynx – drools saliva into us, and delivers chemicals that keep our blood flowing. Mosquito saliva also makes our blood vessels dilate, blocks our immune response and lubricates the proboscis.  It causes us to develop itchy welts, and serves as a conduit for dangerous viruses and parasites.

---+ What is the deadliest animal in the world?
Mosquitoes are the deadliest animals in the world to us humans. The diseases they transmit kill hundreds of thousands of people each year. 
 
---+ How many people get malaria each year?
In 2015, malaria, the deadliest mosquito-borne disease, killed roughly 635,000 people, mostly children under the age of five and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. 

---+ What diseases do mosquitoes transmit?
Malaria, dengue, yellow fever, West Nile and Zika are some of the diseases that mosquitoes transmit. 

Dengue fever, transmitted Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, is estimated to make almost 400 million people sick with jabbing joint pain each year. 

Scientists also believe that Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the main culprit for more than 350 confirmed cases of congenital malformations associated with the Zika virus in the northeastern Brazilian state of Pernambuco. Since last October, an unusually high number of babies have been born there with small heads and a host of health problems like convulsions, suspected of being caused by a Zika virus infection early in their mother’s pregnancy.

---+ What diseases can I get from mosquitoes in the United States?
West Nile virus is the most important of several mosquito-transmitted viruses now native to the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control.

Nelson Hall wants you to know that the googly-eyed flatworm he just sliced into four pieces is going to be OK.

Three of the flatworm’s four pieces have started to wriggle away from each other and its head is moving in circles under Hall’s microscope. “The head will just go off and do its own thing,” said Hall, a doctoral student of bioengineering at Stanford University.
 
But in three weeks, the head, as well as the other pieces, will each have grown into a complete flatworm just like the one Hall sliced up, dark brown and about a half-inch long. 

Hall and researchers around the world are hard at work trying to understand how these flatworms, called planarians, use powerful stem cells to regenerate their entire bodies, an ability humans can only dream of. 

Animals like starfish, salamanders and crabs can regrow a tail or a leg. Planarians, on the other hand, can regrow their entire bodies – even their heads, which only a few animals can do.

---What is the difference between healing and regeneration?
When we suffer a severe injury, the best we can hope for is that our wounds will heal. “Healing is more like closing the wound and cleaning debris. It’s too short of a process to have tissue replacement,” said Hall. “Regeneration is replacing the tissue that was lost.”

---What are pluripotent stem cells?
If planarians can regrow body parts, why can’t we? Key to planarians’ regenerative ability are powerful cells called pluripotent stem cells, which make up one-fifth of their bodies and can grow into every new body part. Humans only have pluripotent stem cells during the embryonic stage, before birth. After that, we mostly lose our ability to sprout new organs.

“We have a couple of tissues that can regenerate, like the liver, the outer layers of the skin and the inner layers of the intestine, and the bone marrow,” said Dr. Stephen Badylak, Deputy Director of the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. “But the way we heal most tissues is by forming scar tissue.”

Scientists hope that studying planarians could lead to treatments for humans in which our stem cells could be coaxed one day to regrow severed limbs or sick organs. 

---How to grow a fingertip.
Doctors are limited in what they can currently do to help people who lose a limb or part of one. Badylak, who doesn’t study planarians, has developed a treatment at the University of Pittsburgh that helps patients regrow their fingertips after an accident.

He applies a powder made of animal collagen and substances that stimulate cells to grow, to help form a scaffold that attracts stem cells from the parts of the nail that weren’t cut off. The stem cells regrow the fingertip, which isn’t identical to the one that was cut off, but is functional.

---+ About Dust Mites

With the warming weather it’s the season for spring cleaning. But before you reach for the broom and mop, take a moment to look at who else is sharing your home with you. The number of uninvited guests you find in your dustpan may surprise you.

A recent study published in the journal PeerJ took up the challenge of cataloging the large numbers of tiny animals that live in human dwellings. The researchers found that the average home contains roughly 100 different species of arthropods, including familiar types like flies, spiders and ants, but also some kinds that are less well known like gall wasps and book lice. And no matter how much human residents may clean, there will always be a considerable number of mini-roommates.

“Even as entomologists we were really surprised. We live in our houses all the time, so we thought we’d be more familiar with the kind of things we’d come across.

Dust mites are tiny animals, related to spiders, that are usually too small to be seen with the naked eye. They feed on dead skin that humans shed every day and their droppings may cause allergic reactions and may aggravate asthma, especially in children.

---+ How do you minimize dust mites? 

It’s practically impossible to completely rid a home of dust mites, but frequent cleaning and removing carpeting can help. Wet cleaning like mopping helps keep from stirring up dust while cleaning. The most effective way to keep dust mite populations down is to keep the indoor humidity level low. Dust mites can only survive in humid environments. 

---+ How do you see dust mites?

Dust mites are about .2mm long. You can see dust mites with a powerful magnifying glass, but you can get a better view by using a  microscope.

Spring is here, and with it, the start of flea season. With the warming weather, people and their pets are spending more time outside — which increases the chances of bringing home a hungry “itch hiker.”
While pet owners curse the tiny insects and look for a way to rid them from their homes, it turns out fleas actually perform some remarkable athletic feats, like jumping 50 times their height — the equivalent of a human jumping 300 feet — or leaping so fast that they take off 100 times faster than the blink of an eye.
No larger than a sesame seed and flattened side to side, fleas can slip through fur with ease. Their jump is so fast they seem to simply vanish and reappear somewhere else.
“It's there and then it's gone,” said Gregory Sutton, a professor of biomechanics at the University of Lincoln in the United Kingdom.

--- What do flea eggs look like?
After feeding on blood, adult fleas mate and lay eggs. The eggs drop out of their host animal’s fur or feathers and into their bedding or nest. The eggs are translucent white and very small. At 0.5mm the eggs are about the size of a grain of salt.

--- Why do fleas bite me?
Blood is a protein-rich food for fleas. Adult fleas feed on blood before they can procreate.

--- Why does my dog/cat keep getting fleas?
Fleas are nest parasites. Their eggs fall from the host animal into its bedding where they hatch. The worm-like larvae feed on organic debris (including the adult fleas’ feces) in the bedding. They then curl up into a cocoon and undergo metamorphosis into their adult form. Flea baths tend to kill the fleas currently on the pet, but there may still be flea eggs and larvae in the pet’s bedding. When those young fleas mature they may reinfest the pet.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a powerful microscope-based technique that uses an antibody to view a specific protein in biological tissue. It is often used to diagnose abnormal cells in solid tumors, visualize molecular markers for cellular events like apoptosis, and monitor the localizations and expression of biomarkers. However, individuals new to this method can struggle due to the many steps in the procedure that can each add variations that will impact staining. 

Cell Signaling Technology (CST) scientists have determined optimal conditions for CST antibodies developed and validated in-house for IHC. In this video, we demonstrate the IHC protocol we have optimized for formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections so you can replicate results in your laboratory and obtain consistent results.   

We will first describe how to prepare your sample and deparaffinization/rehydrate the FFPE samples followed by the antigen unmasking step, the most difficult step in an IHC protocol. Next, we will review chromogenic staining with the SignalStain DAB Substrate Kit followed by how to mount sections to a coverslip before viewing on a microscope. Finally, we describe how using different conditions than those recommended each antibody Product Data Sheet, like changing the recommended antibody diluent, can affect your final results.

In this 45 min presentation, Aldrin Gomes, Associate Professor of Neurobiology at UC Davis, talks about key success factors to instill trust in western blotting data.

Western blotting is a widely used technique to identify and quantify proteins in complex samples. Unfortunately, as an editor of several journals, Prof. Gomes routinely observes Western blots that are not properly conducted. The generally low quality of western blotting data has led scientists to question whether we can trust protein quantification when using western blots. Reducing errors and misinterpretations requires standardized procedure and proper controls.

In this webinar, Prof. Gomes discusses the following key factors for high-confidence western blot data:
1) Quality of the primary and secondary antibodies and the blocking reagent
2) Proper target protein controls
3) Choice of total protein loading control vs. housekeeping protein loading control to normalize the target protein measurement

Prof. Gomes also presents tips to reduce the overall time required for first-rate western blots an how to minimize the pain of going through a long procedure. The scientific community needs to continue to increase the awareness of problems associated with western blotting and introduce, improve, and standardize basic criteria for western blotting practices so that the most investigators will be successful in eliminating common problems associated with ""bad"" western blots.

Western blotting is a widely used immunoassay used by research scientists to monitor expression of a specific protein in a complex cell or tissue extract. It utilizes antibodies that recognize a specific protein of interest or a post-translational modification like phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitination. At Cell Signaling Technology (CST), we perform thousands of Western blots daily using a protocol that has been optimized for over a decade to develop and validate antibodies with exceptional specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility. 

We first list all the the solutions and reagents you’ll need. Then, we give detailed descriptions on how to prepare the sample, perform the protein blot and immunoassay, and detect proteins chemiluminescently. Finally, we describe critical experimental steps in Western blotting and explain how small changes to the protocol, like changing incubation times or dilution buffers, can affect the final outcome of your blot. 

To learn more about how to generate publication ready Western blot data, check out our troubleshooting video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ9gGb8bqn8). If you’re interested in alternate protocols, including preparing your sample with immunoprecipitation, re-probing your membrane, and detecting your protein using fluorescence detection, visit the Protocol at the Cell Signaling Technology website (https://www.cellsignal.com/protocols).",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yUstng0npaY/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-12 13:10:02.719041

Southern blotting step by step explanation is provided to understand the procedure of the DNA separation and identification. Southern blotting application is also explained in this video. 
Southern blotting consists of three different stages - 
1. First is the isolation of DNA from the target cell. 
2. Then the treatment of restriction digestion of the DNA to generate DNA fragments 
3. Then the separation of the DNA fragments using Agarose gel electrophoresis 
4. Transfer of the Agarose gel DNA bands to a nitrocellulose Membrane filter. This filter paper after the DNA transfer is known as southern blot. 
5.  Then the use of complementary DNA probe to bind with the target DNA that will indicate the presence of target sequence by radioactivity or colorize trick expression. Southern blotting was invented by EM Southern on 1975 at it was named after him to identify DNA using blotting technique.

fDD_rD032Lc,Shomu's Biology,UCEPMCywJ6FPZpQ_aPEZt5JA,1467208673.0,HPLC chromatography,"HPLC chromatography lecture - This lecture explains about the HPLC chromatography technique in a nutshell by Suman Bhattacharjee. HPLC is performed to separate organic and biological compounds using solid stationary phase.
High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is a form of column chromatography that pumps a sample mixture or analyte in a solvent which is known as the mobile phase at high pressure through a column with chromatographic packing material known as stationary phase. The sample is carried by a moving carrier gas stream of helium or nitrogen. HPLC has the ability to separate, and identify compounds that are present in any sample that can be dissolved in a liquid in trace concentrations as low as parts per trillion. Because of this versatility, HPLC is used in a variety of industrial and scientific applications, such as pharmaceutical, environmental, forensics, and chemicals.
Sample retention time will vary depending on the interaction between the stationary phase, the molecules being analyzed, and the solvent, or solvents used. As the sample passes through the column it interacts between the two phases at different rate, primarily due to different polarities in the analytes. Analytes that have the least amount of interaction with the stationary phase or the most amount of interaction with the mobile phase will exit the column faster.
This lecture explains the following things about Hplc chromatography - 
1. Hplc chromatography principle
2. Hplc chromatography instrumentation
3. Hplc chromatography types

High-Performance Liquid Chromatography - Other HPLC Types
Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography (uHPLC): 
Where standard HPLC typically uses column particles with sizes from 3 to 5µm and pressures of around 400 bar, uHPLC use specially designed columns with particles down to 1.7µm in size, at pressures in excess of 1000 bar. The main advantage of an uHPLC is speed. These systems are faster, more sensitive, and rely on smaller volumes of organic solvents than standard HPLC, resulting in the ability to run more samples in less time.

Comparative genomic hybridization is a molecular cytogenetic method for analysing copy number variations (CNVs) relative to ploidy level in the DNA of a test sample compared to a reference sample, without the need for culturing cells. The aim of this technique is to quickly and efficiently compare two genomic DNA samples arising from two sources, which are most often closely related, because it is suspected that they contain differences in terms of either gains or losses of either whole chromosomes or subchromosomal regions (a portion of a whole chromosome). This technique was originally developed for the evaluation of the differences between the chromosomal complements of solid tumor and normal tissue,[1] and has an improved resoIution of 5-10 megabases compared to the more traditional cytogenetic analysis techniques of giemsa banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) which are limited by the resolution of the microscope utilized.[2][3]

This is achieved through the use of competitive fluorescence in situ hybridization. In short, this involves the isolation of DNA from the two sources to be compared, most commonly a test and reference source, independent labelling of each DNA sample with a different fluorophores (fluorescent molecules) of different colours (usually red and green), denaturation of the DNA so that it is single stranded, and the hybridization of the two resultant samples in a 1:1 ratio to a normal metaphase spread of chromosomes, to which the labelled DNA samples will bind at their locus of origin. Using a fluorescence microscope and computer software, the differentially coloured fluorescent signals are then compared along the length of each chromosome for identification of chromosomal differences between the two sources. A higher intensity of the test sample colour in a specific region of a chromosome indicates the gain of material of that region in the corresponding source sample, while a higher intensity of the reference sample colour indicates the loss of material in the test sample in that specific region. A neutral colour (yellow when the fluorophore labels are red and green) indicates no difference between the two samples in that location.[2][3]

CGH is only able to detect unbalanced chromosomal abnormalities. This is because balanced chromosomal abnormalities such as reciprocal translocations, inversions or ring chromosomes do not affect copy number, which is what is detected by CGH technologies. CGH does, however, allow for the exploration of all 46 human chromosomes in single test and the discovery of deletions and duplications, even on the microscopic scale which may lead to the identification of candidate genes to be further explored by other cytological techniques.[2][4]

Through the use of DNA microarrays in conjunction with CGH techniques, the more specific form of array CGH (aCGH) has been developed, allowing for a locus-by-locus measure of CNV with increased resolution as low as 100 kilobases.[5][6] This improved technique allows for the aetiology of known and unknown conditions to be discovered.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QvXnn7kTmkY/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-12 13:10:07.873757
oJcDk5I39y8,Luminex Corporation,UC_N007PC-IfpHD39OsupLhg,1510580459.0,Luminex Detection Methods - Molecular Diagnostics & Life Sciences,"Luminex Detection Methods - Molecular Diagnostics & Life Sciences

Luminex has several detection method technologies for analyzing the results of assays. Being familiar with these helps to understand how Luminex hardware works. 

One detection method Luminex uses to identify beads and if the target is present is called flow cytometry. With flow cytometry the beads are fed into a compartment called a cuvette and are individually scanned buy a red and a green laser. The red 620 nanometer laser excites dyes within the beads to identify the bead region. The red laser works but the set of sensors that detect the dye concentrations of the bead. The green 535 nanometer laser identifies the fluorescence of the reporter molecule. It works with its own sensor. Both the bead ideas mapped and the median fluorescence intensity is measured.

Another detection method is fluorescent imager analysis. This method reads all the beads at once. The beads are all fed into a chamber where they are captured by a magnetized wall. The magnetic MagPlex beads are required for this method. Once the beads are in place, a red 635 nanometer and a green 525 nanometer LED shine on the beads to excite the dyes and reporter. Then a CCD camera is used to identify each bead region as well as quantify the analyte binding events. Once complete the magnet moves away from the chamber releasing the beads to be flushed from the instrument.

Another detection method Luminex uses is fluorimeter detection. This method uses six LEDs that shine on six photodiode detectors using Fiber Optic Cables. Each LED is a different wavelength sand will excite different reporters. A PCR tube containing an assay being run is placed between the LED and photodiode to see if there is fluorescence. The LEDs and reporters are ultraviolet blue, green, white, amber and red. The fluorescence is charted for each Channel and Sample.

Nanoparticle imaging which utilizes Nanogrid technology is another powerful Luminex detection method. This method analyzes slides covered in spots called Nanogrids to detect the presence or absence of targets. Each spot contains a strand of DNA or probe complementary to the various targets of interest. After a series of hybridizations with the sample, nucleic acid mediators, gold nanoparticles and a silver solution help LED lights shine on the slide and camera takes images of the slide at multiple exposures. Any probes or spots that have Incorporated the various hybridization reagents scatter light back to the camera creating a visible spot on the slide if the target nucleic acid is present in the sample. This box with no complimentary samples nucleic acid attachments and therefore no silver coated gold nanoparticles do not scatter light back to the camera and remain dark. The Luminex instrument to determine the presence or absence of light scatter on the Nanogrids. 

The detection methods Luminex uses to analyze assays are flow cytometry fluorescent imager analysis detection, fluorimeter detection and nanoparticle imaging. Since different instruments
use different technologies the type of analysis needed for an assay will dictate the instrument used.

t7I3tzoroj4,Luminex Corporation,UC_N007PC-IfpHD39OsupLhg,1469621979.0,Luminex xMAP® Technology,"Luminex's xMAP® Technology combines advanced fluidics, optics, and digital signal processing with proprietary microsphere technology to deliver multiplex assay capabilities. Featuring a flexible, open-architecture design, xMAP® Technology can be configured to perform a wide variety of protein or nucleic acid assays quickly, cost-effectively and accurately.

How xMAP Technology Works
 
Open-architecture xMAP Technology enables multiplexing of biological tests (assays), reducing time, labor, and costs over traditional methods such as ELISA, western blotting, PCR, and traditional arrays. Systems using xMAP Technology perform discrete assays on the surface of color coded beads known as microspheres, which are then read in a compact analyzer. Using multiple lasers or LEDs and high-speed digital-signal processors, the analyzer reads multiplex assay results by reporting the reactions occurring on each individual microsphere.

It has a streamlined workflow that reduces the risk of contamination, with improved clinical performance, analyzed by SYNCT software. The plate itself holds 96 pre-loaded, sealed wells in 12, 8-well strips. The strips can be removed or even cut to scale with demand, from 1 to 96 wells.  Each well contains LBR, or Lyophilized Bead Reagents. All the reagents for the assay (primers, dNTPs, polymerase, beads, and reporters) are lyophilized, or dehydrated, into these beads. Having everything already in the plate reduces waste and streamlines the workflow.

NxTAG is the next generation assay from Luminex.

Biobased fibers made from renewable sources could be useful for a variety of applications, including textiles or medical devices. But it can be difficult to make long, continuous threads from these materials. Now, researchers have made sturdy, flexible threads from a combination of chitin nanofibers extracted from crab shells and alginate, a compound found in seaweed. The team studied how differences in the concentration of each component, the size of the nanofibers, and other variables affected the mechanical properties and spinnability of the final thread. With this information, the researchers were able to produce strong, flexible threads continuously, limited only by the volume of each component.

Flow cytometry is a method for analysing cells, used by immunologists and many other fields. Flow cytometers work through micro fluidics (to flow the cells) and use lasers for generating information on cell size(FSC), cell granularity (SSC) and fluorescence. In flow cytometry data, each cell is 1 dot. Gating is used to focus in on the cells of interest. Fluorescence is used, by dye or anti-body labelling to get information on the sample. Cell sorting facilitated capturing the cell population of interest for further experiments. 

I share some flow cytometry data examples to understand a gating workflow and how to read gating. 

I found a clear example of cell sorting of fluorescent parasites inside a host cell. This includes microscopy of the sorted cells. I find it hard to imagine things without microscopy, I'm a visual learner so I hope these examples were nice and clear. 

Pop any questions you have in the comment section and I'll do my best to answer them. BUT disclaimer- I'm just a grad student with a few years of hands-on experience & I'm not an expert.

This video provides an excellent introduction to flow cytometry.  Dr. Malte Paulsen covers the basic principles of the technique including fluidics, optics and data display.
 
Talk Overview:
Dr. Malte Paulsen gives an introduction to flow cytometry with an excellent explanation of the basic principles governing the technique. He explains how fluid flow is used to focus a sample in a laser beam. Light from the laser is scattered by cells in the sample and the degree of scatter provides information about the cell’s optical density and other characteristics. In conventional flow cytometry, lasers are used primarily to excite fluorescent antibodies bound to specific cell types.  A detector with different filters allows specific wavelengths to be dissected from the overall fluorescence.  This signal can then be displayed in ways that provide the most information about the cell type of interest.

Speaker Biography:
Dr. Malte Paulsen has been Head of the Flow Cytometry Core Facility at EMBL since 2015. Prior to joining EMBL, Paulsen was Head of the flow cytometry facilities first at Institute for Molecular Biology (IMB) in Mainz, and later at the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College, London.  Paulsen received his PhD from the German Cancer Research Center and the University of Heidelberg in 2011.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W1BFeiDwqnk/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-12 13:10:13.412011

-r3HNA78AWA,Logical Biology,UCXHTAlPGzMEEcg8fG4OW3uw,1550941999.0,How to study immunology,"From last 3 years I have been teaching different subjects to students of life sciences and biology background. These students included from Bachelors, Masters, even PhD students and college teachers from different streams of Biological Sciences and Life Sciences. In these years I have heard these lines so many times that “Immunology is very difficult to study” or “Immunology is very difficult to understand” or “Immunology is very difficult to remember”. As my research area or you can say research interest is immunology I personally feel that even if Immunology is a very interesting it gets difficult to understand and study because of these 3 problems –

    Students have to study a vast array of signalling pathways, a huge number of proteins, receptors, ligands cytokines, chemokines, signaling molecules etc.
    They have to study a variety of immune responses which are dependent on a very complex network of cells and signaling molecules (For example there can be hundreds of CD molecules).
    Immunology uses a very high number of techniques from cell biology, animal biotechnology, recombinant DNA technology etc so it gets difficult for the students to connect all the dots.

In this post I am giving some study tips for Immunology and hope that it will be helpful for you guys –
A. Select a good book to study the subject Immunology –

There are many good books of immunology, here are some of them for your consideration –

Immunology
Textbook by Barbara A. Osborne and Janis Kuby
Janeway’s Immunobiology (My personal favourite because easy to study with great details of subject).
Textbook by Kenneth Murphy, Mark Walport, and Paul Travers
Cellular and Molecular Immunology
Book by Abul K. Abbas and Andrew H. Lichtman
Fundamental Immunology (Legendary book of subject but I would suggest to read Kuby or Janway before starting it) 
Textbook by William E Paul
B. Continuity is very important
In immunology all the chapters and topics are totally interconnected so when you read the books never jump any topic or chapter. For an instance if I try to understand the T cell signaling then it is impossible to understand it without studying antigen presentation to T cells. For another instance without studying antigens and antigenic determinants the knowledge of vaccine design can not be grasped properly.
C. Make charts of following things because they are used again and again during the whole study of Immunology –

    Types of cells in immune system and their functions (T cells, B cells, Dendritic cells, Macrophages etc.)
    Types of receptors and surface proteins present on immune cells and in immune system with their functions (MHCI.MHCII, TCR, BCR, different types of antibodies etc).
    Different cytokines, there receptors and their functions as cytokines are major regulatory molecules in immunological networks.

D.Learning about proteins is very important.

Learn about amino acid sequence patterns, 3D structure of proteins, and protease enzymes as these things help you to understand the molecular aspects of Immunology like antigen interaction with MHC molecules, antigen antibody interactions etc.
E. Study the immune response based on type of pathogen or antigens. Some suitable examples are here-

    Virus or viral antigens – CD4 Th1 cells which secrete IFN gamma to create antiviral state.
    Bacteria or bacterial antigens – Macrophages and CD4 Th2 cells which secrete IL4 and IL5.
    Tumor cells and tumor antigens – CD8 cytotoxic T cells which secrete granzymes and  CD4 Th1 cells.

F. Study the techniques related to Immunology because Immunology is more of an experimental subject. Here is a list of some techniques with their important applications –

    ELISA – To study antigen-antibody interactions, to quantify secreted cytokines and chemokines, to perform T cell assays.
    ELISPOT and cytokine bead array – To analyze different cytokines and for quantify serum cytokine levels.
    Flowcytometry – To do immunophenotyping of different cellular populations of immune system cells like Th17 cells, regulatory t cells, hematopoietic stem cells, different types of antigen presenting cells etc.
    Magnetic cell sorting – Used to purify cells from mixed populations.
    HYBRIDOMA – To produce monoclonal antibodies against a given epitope or antigen.
    Knock in, Knock out and disease model mouse to do in vivo experiments of immunology.

5ZTdspVOhiU,iBiology Techniques,UCimxROEIlNsiRqT9X5tg2XQ,1553757385.0,Imaging Flow Cytometry: A Brief Overview - Andrew Filby (Newcastle U.),"https://www.ibiology.org/techniques/imaging-flow-cytometry

In this talk, Dr. Andrew Filby provides an overview of imaging flow cytometry, a powerful technique used to measure the phenotype of cells using image-based metrics. Compared with traditional flow cytometry, imaging flow cytometry increases the number of parameters one can measure by providing morphological and spatial information in a high-throughput, controlled manner. Filby explains how the imaging flow cytometer works and describes the benefits of using this technique to better answer biological questions, as well as giving us a glimpse into the future of this exciting field.

Speaker Biography:
Dr. Andrew Filby is the Director of the flow cytometry core facility at Newcastle University in the UK. He received his bachelor’s degree in biochemistry from the University of Huddersfield, and his Ph.D. in molecular and cellular immunology from the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) in Mill Hill, London. Filby joined the laboratory of Dr. George Kassiotis at the NIMR where he continued his post-doctoral training. After his post doc, he joined the London Research Institute as the deputy head of the cytometry core facility. Filby continues to innovate and develop new cytometric applications in his current position at Newcastle University.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5ZTdspVOhiU/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-12 13:10:13.657513

Multicolor flow cytometry is the analysis of multiple fluorescent parameters in one sample. Building large flow cytometry panels can be daunting because each additional fluorophore you add to your panel has the potential to influence another fluorophore.
Join our webinar to learn which fluorophores are compatible with each other, how they interact and can affect your staining and how to obtain optimal resolution of signal. Furthermore, we will show you how dump channels, fluorophore brightness, antigen density, marker expression patterns and instrument configuration can all contribute to improving your panel design.
This webinar is recommended for both novices and researchers with some experience of flow cytometry.

Speaker Biography:
Presented by: Dr Sebastian Hedlund, Flow Cytometry Specialist at Bio-Rad Laboratories Sebastian obtained his degree from the Institute of Technology, Linköping University, Sweden, followed by an MSc in Medical Biology from the same institute. He then moved to Freiburg, Germany where he obtained his PhD in Immunology and Molecular Biology at the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics. The focus of his thesis was the role of microRNA in innate immunity and immunopathology. He then left academia and started work as a dedicated flow cytometry specialist, before joining Bio-Rad in 2016 as the flow cytometry specialist for Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, Israel, and South Africa.

In this video, Dan shows you how to disassemble your SDS-PAGE gel, and how to stain it using either PageBlue, Coomassie, or Silver Staining.

Coomassie is the older method of staining, and gives bright blue bands on the gel. PageBlue is similar, but provides a quicker alternative. If you have faint bands and require a more sensitive method, you can use Silver Staining.

Choose whatever method you need, but beware of the hazardous materials that may be used.

Are you looking to perform a gene silencing project? Should you use CRISPR, RNAi, or TALENs to get the job done? In this video, we’ll explain how each system works and how they differ in terms of experimental set-up, efficiency, off-target effects, and more. You'll learn some important considerations when setting up projects using each system and some common applications.

The first thing you need to know is the difference between a gene knockout and a gene knockdown. A gene knockout is when a gene has acquired a frameshift mutation such that the cell no longer expresses any functional protein.  A gene knockdown is when gene expression is reduced but not completely eliminated. CRISPR and TALENs are used to perform gene knockouts or introduce genetic mutations whereas RNAi is used for gene knockdowns. 

Some systems, such as CRISPR and RNAi are easier to design whereas other systems such as TALENs can be more labor intensive. Some systems such as CRISPR and TALENs can be modified to expand their uses in gene manipulation whereas other systems such as RNAi are more restricted in their uses. Similarly, some systems such as CRISPR can be modified to reduce off-target effects, whereas other systems, such as RNAi can cause significant off-target effects.

We hope this video helps you decide which system is best for your gene silencing project!

ZzoE43fBXdw,GENNews,UCoHRSQ0ahscV14hlmPabkVQ,1427887221.0,Getting Better Western Results,"Western blotting has become a pillar in protein biology workflows by combining molecular weight-based separation with high-affinity protein-specific antibody-based detection, and has been optimized over the years to address common concerns. Recently, innovative advancements have dramatically improved the performance of western blotting while reducing hands-on time of this classically laborious, yet powerful protein detection method.

During this webinar, presenters will discuss challenges with the traditional western blot workflow and introduce convenient and cost-effective solutions that enable better western results. You will also learn about the new iBind™ Western System, an automated western blot processing device that is hands-free, reproducible, requires less primary antibody and is compatible with downstream western blot detection protocols.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZzoE43fBXdw/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-12 13:10:18.512563

The assay is based on the observation that the absorbance maximum for an acidic solution of Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 shifts from 465 nm to 595 nm when binding to protein occurs. Both hydrophobic and ionic interactions stabilize the anionic form of the dye, causing a visible color change. Within the linear range of the assay (~5-25 mcg/ml), the more protein present, the more Coomassie binds.

Robyn Murphy, Associate Professor at the School of Life Sciences of Latrobe University, has developed a unique protocol to conduct western blotting on muscles at single-cell levels to examine fiber type-specific protein expression patterns. Find out how Bio-Rad's stain-free gel technology helps ensure quantitative analysis in this unique procedure.

Western blotting has been used for protein analyses in a wide range of tissue samples for more than 30 years. Over the past few years, Prof. Murphy has used skeletal muscle to develop a protocol for quantitatively analyzing proteins in very small samples sizes, here 1--3 mm segments of skeletal muscle fibers (individual muscle cells). This amounts to 5--10 µg total mass of tissue or 1--3 µg total protein.  

Through the development of this technique, it has become apparent that using very small amounts of representative sample presents the most optimal situation for analyzing proteins. The introduction of Bio-Rad's stain-free gels has allowed the methodology to advance, whereby an assessment of total protein can be attained during the normal western blotting protocol. When combined with a calibration curve, quantitative assessment is achievable. In this webinar, Prof. Murphy demonstrates how western blotting can be reliable and quantitative and hence remain extremely valuable for making biological measurements.

Transcript:
What's the difference between crosslinking aldehyde fixatives and alcohol based fixatives for immunofluorescence? Hi, I'm John Burford, senior research associate on the Immunofluorescence Validation team here at Cell Signaling Technology, and this is CST Tech Tips. 

Fixation is an important step in the IF protocol. Fixation works by stopping the activity of endogenous proteases in the sample so that proteins aren't lost, and by preserving the sample architecture so you can then introduce antibodies to detect your protein of interest. 

Ideally, fixation would not alter the ability of antibodies to detect proteins, but unfortunately fixatives do have an impact on the epitopes, and can also affect the fluorescent properties of the sample itself. Because of this, it's important for you as an antibody user to understand the different types of fixation approaches. 

For IF, there are two main classes of fixatives. First, are aldehyde based crosslinking fixatives which form chemical bridges between the lysine groups of proteins, providing structural stabilization to the cell. There are three potential challenges with crosslinking fixatives. One, when proteins are packed tightly together and highly crosslinked, it may be difficult for the antibody to access the protein of interest. Second, if the antibody does make it to the protein, the epitope it recognizes may be chemically altered, effectively inhibiting antibody binding. Third, aldehyde fixation can create autofluorescent byproducts in the sample that increase nonspecific background in IF. This can be somewhat avoided by choosing longer wavelength, lower energy fluorophores. 

The second type of fixation approach is alcohol based organic solvent fixation. This works by stripping the proteins of their hydration barrier, effectively dehydrating the sample. This washes away soluble proteins, but precipitates the proteins that remain and alters their tertiary structure. This can help antibodies access otherwise hidden epitopes, at the cost of losing soluble proteins. 

Here at CST, we test all IF antibodies so you can be confident they'll work with the recommended fixation protocol. When designing your IF experiments, check the product pages at http://cellsignal.com for the appropriate protocol for your antibody. Any time you have questions about an antibody or a protocol, you can reach out to one of our scientists, such as myself, at http://cellsignal.com/support.

The next step of tissue preparation is fixation. Fixation refers to a chemical means of killing and preserving cells in a particular physiological state, and in many cases, to preserve morphology. Proper fixation equals preservation of target.

The next step of tissue preparation is fixation. (Here, fixation refers to fixed cell systems, such as antibody labeling.) Fixation refers to a chemical means of killing and preserving cells in a particular physiological state, and in many cases, to preserve morphology. The process to achieve this is to crosslink with aldehydes or through solvent fixation. Crosslinking with formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde preserves the structure by crosslinking proteins, that is the amine groups on these proteins, which creates rigidity to the cells or tissue, thus preserving them in that state. However, crosslinking can mask antigen-binding sites. Should an antibody need to bind, antigen retrieval or a protease treatment must take place to unmask or reveal those sites. Additionally, increased autofluorescence, a fluorescence native to the tissue, increases upon crosslinking. Glutaraldehyde has twice the crosslinking power, but it also has twice the autofluorescence. Another possibility is the use of a solvent-based method such as methanol fixation. This method permeabilizes the cells by delipidizing, and opens the cells as well as the antigen-binding site. Some antibodies demand a solvent base, especially if the antibody is a nuclear antigen. However, this method does not the preserve morphology as well as doing the crosslinking with aldehydes. Some membrane-bound components and proteins can be lost. In addition, labeling live cells with a membrane dye such as DiIC18, the components and proteins can with lost with acetone or methanol fixation. Image 8 offers an example of poor fixation. Here, the cells on the left appear fragmented. (Cells that are labeled with a phalloidin to label the F-actin in red.) Cells on the right have been properly fixed. This is evidenced by good morphology and good actin structure. These cells were fixed with formaldehyde. The image also indicates the basic protocol, fixing between 2% and 4%. Methanol-free gives the most success. Formalin, for example, is methanol-stabilized formaldehyde. Most often, the protocol should include the use of methanol-free, EM grade, and fix for 10 to 15 minutes in PBS or another physiological buffer at either room temperature or 37 degrees. Thirty-seven degrees is generally recommend to ensure that, in the last moment before fixation, the cells are still in their proper physiological state. After fixation, wash is recommended. Some cells that are labeled live, technically, are not fixable. Some might be retained. Regarding cells that are labeled live and then fixed, some dyes like nucleic acid stains do not actually crosslink in place, and a fixation will not preserve them. The image on the lower left offers an example of tissue labeled with three colors, three different fluorescent dyes. When put at a warm temperature, 37 degrees for 14 days, the dyes slowly diffuse. This is due to the fact that the dyes are not crosslinked in place, resulting in a washed out appearance. However, some dyes are fixable. The image on the upper right shows two versions of the dye at the top of the gallery. Top left is the dye called FM4-64 on live cells. Top right is the FX, or fixable version of this, on live cells. In the process of fixing the cells, the FM 4-64 (left) is lost, leading to a much-reduced signal. However, the one on the right has amine groups crosslinked in place by aldehydes, and thus retained. It is possible to execute a post-fixation as well, to crosslink, for example, an antibody in place so as not to lose it over time as the slide is archived. The result of proper fixation is preserving the target for later use. Proper fixation equals preservation of target.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XU9kI9HgfDU/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-12 13:10:23.038960

Immunocytochemistry (ICC) - Video Protocol: https://youtu.be/KnSLt8tJPPI

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) refers to the process of detecting antigens (e.g. proteins) in cells of a tissue section by exploiting the principle of antibodies binding specifically to antigens in biological tissues. IHC takes its name from the roots ""immuno"", in reference to antibodies used in the procedure, and ""histo,"" meaning tissue (compare to immunocytochemistry). The procedure was conceptualized and first implemented by Albert Coons in 1941.

Immunohistochemical staining is widely used in the diagnosis of abnormal cells such as those found in cancerous tumors. Specific molecular markers are characteristic of particular cellular events such as proliferation or cell death (apoptosis). 

Immunohistochemistry is also widely used in basic research to understand the distribution and localization of biomarkers and differentially expressed proteins in different parts of a biological tissue.

Visualising an antibody-antigen interaction can be accomplished in a number of ways. In the most common instance, an antibody is conjugated to an enzyme, such as peroxidase, that can catalyse a colour-producing reaction (see immunoperoxidase staining). Alternatively, the antibody can also be tagged to a fluorophore, such as fluorescein or rhodamine.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ADmb25PIkqs/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-12 13:10:23.297493

Modern AI tries to take inspiration from living neurons, but why settle for the synthetic version? By growing human neurons directly connected to a computer it's possible to make a living AI of sorts capable of even complex tasks like flying a plane in a simulation. 

Today we explore our first attempt at doing exactly that. We cover building the first prototype multi electrode array, growing the neurons and attempting to take some readings from them. This is the first part of what will hopefully be a many part series, so stay tuned for updates!

How to perform Plasmid DNA transfection with Lipofectamine® LTX and Plus™ Reagent protocol.  Superior plasmid delivery and protein expression.

In this video, we will perform a plasmid DNA transfection experiment using Lipofectamine® LTX & Plus™ reagent.

As always, use good cell culture practices and wear your personal protective equipment. Be sure to clean your cell culture hood and work surface by spraying and wiping them down with 70% ethanol.

The day prior to your transfection, seed your cells so that they will be 70% to 90% confluent at the time of your experiment.

For this transfection experiment you will need:
- Lipofectamine® LTX and Plus™ Reagent
- Opti-MEM® Reduced-Serum Medium
- Plasmid DNA at 1 microgram per microliter. We will be using a Green Fluorescent Protein plasmid to serve as a positive control for transfection.
- Five, 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes in a rack
- A P200 and P10 pipette and appropriate tips
- A marker and a timer
- And a 24-well plate with 70% to 90% confluent cells.

We will be following the 24-well plate format of the Lipofectamine® LTX & Plus™ Reagent protocol.

Prepare 4 tubes each with 50 microliter of Opti-MEM® Medium, and label them 1 to 4.

Add 2 microliters of Lipofectamine® LTX Reagent to tube 1, 3 microliters to tube 2, 4 microliters to tube 3 and 5 microliters to tube 4.

Mix each tube well by vortexing or flicking the tube.

Prepare a tube with 250 microliters of Opti-MEM® medium and add 5 micrograms of plasmid DNA. Since, our DNA concentration is at 1 microgram per mircoliter we are adding 5 microliters. Next add 5 microliters of Plus™ Reagent and mix well.

Add 50 microliters of the diluted DNA to each of the Lipofectamine® LTX dilutions in tubes 1 to 4.

Incubate the complex for 5 minutes at room temperature.

After the 5-minute incubation, remove your 24-well plate containing your cells from the incubator and bring it to the workspace in the hood.

Add 50 microliters of the DNA-reagent complex from tubes 1 to 4 to wells 1 to 4 of the 24-well plate, respectively.

You should have enough volume to run duplicates on the same plate if desired.

Place your 24-well plate back into the incubator and grow cells for 1 to 3 days at 37 Celsius.

After incubating your cells, assess the transfection efficiency in each well by viewing GFP fluorescence. Examine each well using a FLoid cell imaging station or microscope to determine which concentration of reagent provided the highest transfection efficiency.

In this experiment dilution 3 provided the highest transfection efficiency.

Immunocytochemistry (ICC) is a common laboratory technique that is used to anatomically visualize the localization of a specific protein or antigen in cells by use of a specific primary antibody that binds to it. The primary antibody allows visualization of the protein under a fluorescence microscope when it is bound by a secondary antibody that has a conjugated fluorophore. ICC allows researchers to evaluate whether or not cells in a particular sample express the antigen in question. In cases where an immunopositive signal is found, ICC also allows researchers to determine which sub-cellular compartments are expressing the antigen.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KnSLt8tJPPI/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-12 13:10:24.035253

Plasma cells, also called plasma B cells, plasmocytes, and effector B cells, are white blood cells that secrete large volumes of antibodies. They are transported by the blood plasma and the lymphatic system. Like all blood cells, plasma cells originate in the bone marrow. B cells are transformed into the plasma cells while they are ready to produce antibodies. Plasma cells are antibody secreting factories.

DsLooY8KcyE,Shomu's Biology,UCEPMCywJ6FPZpQ_aPEZt5JA,1468313120.0,Cells of immune system,"cells of immunity - This immunology lecture explains about the different types of cells of immune system of human body. Cells of immune system includes T cell, B cell, Natural killer cell or NK cell, Macrophage, neutrophil, monocytes and so on. All these immune system cells function differently with specificity to fight against the infection and disease.
The response to pathogens is orchestrated by the complex interactions and activities of the large number of diverse cell types involved in the immune response. The innate immune response is the first line of defense and occurs soon after pathogen exposure. It is carried out by phagocytic cells such as neutrophils and macrophages, cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells, and granulocytes. The subsequent adaptive immune response includes antigen-specific defense mechanisms and may take days to develop. Cell types with critical roles in adaptive immunity are antigen-presenting cells including macrophages and dendritic cells. Antigen-dependent stimulation of various cell types including T cell subsets, B cells, and macrophages all play critical roles in host defense.

With the new LifeTechnologies developed castPCR technology, somatic mutations now have nowhere to hide. The TaqMan® Mutation Detection Assays use this castPCR™ technology, (which refers to competitive allele-specific TaqMan® PCR) are specifically designed to detect somatic mutations that occur in cancer cells.
Let's see how it works. Let's take an example of a tumor sample in which only 0.1% of the DNA contains a somatic mutation and the other 99.9% is normal, wild type DNA . A mutant allele assay based on castPCR technology contains four components: The allele specific (AS) primer is designed to be specific for a mutant allele in a target gene. A locus specific primer is designed to be specific to the target gene. This will bind to mutant and wild type allele-containing DNA. A locus specific TaqMan® probe is designed to bind to the target gene between the primers. This will also bind to both mutant and wild type allele-containing DNA. This probe will generate a fluorescent signal during the PCR reaction to monitor the target amplification.  An allele specific MGB blocker oligonucleotide is designed to bind specifically to the wild type allele. The role of this blocker is to compete with the mutant allele specific primer and inhibit its binding to the wild type allele. This blocker suppresses non specific amplification of the wild type allele and improves the specificity of the reaction.
Only the mutant allele is amplified and generates a florescent signal. By increasing the specificity and inhibiting the amplification of the wild type allele, this competitive allele-specific TaqMan® PCR provides a very sensitive and specific method to detect as low as 1 mutant allele in a presence of 1000 wild type alleles.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/No80sKCs7qc/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-12 13:10:26.027780

It gives us an overview of the tissue and its structure. Hematoxylin binds with basophilic structures – for example DNA and RNA. So we can observe nuclei stained in blue or purple color. Eosin binds to acidophilic substances such as positively charged amino acid side chains. So as the result cytoplasm is pink or orange. All samples in laboratory are stained with H&E. There are several different types of hematoxylins and eosins used in histology which will give us different results.

In this video you will see, how we stain slides with different types of hematoxylins and eosins. Finally, we will compare the results.

Transcript:
- - What is antigen retrieval? And why is it so important for IHC? I'm Abbey Wells. - And I'm Franny Ambrose. - We are both research associates in the immunohistochemistry group at Cell Signaling Technology. - And this is CST Tech Tips. 

Antigen retrieval, also known as AR, is one of the factors that can influence the strength of staining obtained in IHC. AR made be accomplished by treating the sample with either heat or enzymes. In this video, we'll focus on heat-induced epitope retrieval, or HIER for short. 

Antigen retrieval takes place after deparaffinization of the sample and before the addition of antibodies to detect the target proteins. AR removes the cross-links formed as a result of aldehyde-based fixation and unwinds the protein's secondary and tertiary structure, making epitopes accessible to detection by antibodies. This can be particularly important for epitopes buried deep in the protein structure. 

In your standard HIER protocol, samples are submerged in a buffer and boiled for a period of time, usually 10 to 20 minutes. Heating methods commonly used include a water bath, microwave, or pressure cooker. The level of retrieval can very among these methods, with water baths being the least effective and pressure cooker being the most effective. CST's IHC Protocol recommends using a microwave, which is effective for antigen retrieval, and you probably have one in your lab. 

A common question we get is what unmasking buffer should I use for antigen retrieval. Many antibodies with work well with antigen retrieval performed with citrate buffer. Often with EDTA, you will observe increased signals, but possibly increased background as well. Antibodies that work with citrate buffer are likely to also work with EDTA, but may require further optimization in order to achieve the best signal-to-noise ratio. Conversely, if an antibody requires EDTA for retrieval, it is unlikely to work with with citrate. The antigen retrival buffer that we recommend with our products can be found on the product's data sheet. 

Make your 1x citrate or EDTA and fill your container with 200 mL of that buffer. Fill any empty slots in your slide holders with blank slide. This will ensure that the buffer and heat distribution is consistent between experiments. Leave the lid slightly cracked to allow pressure to escape as this ensures the buffer does not boil over and expose the top of your slides. Also, overheating slides can cause a loss of buffer, which may result in tissues drying out. This can yield false negative results. A common misstep in antigen retrival is aggressive boiling. That can cause tissue to detach from the slide. 

To optimize microwave time and power, we suggest performing a trial run. Use 24 blank slides and 250 mL of buffer and determine how long it takes to reach the initial boil. Next, determine the power level needed to maintain a sub-boiling temperature for 8-10 minutes. Once you have established the conditions for your microwave, perform the retrieval the same way each time, always using the same amount of buffer with empty slots occupied by blank slides.

M3zllm8QbCM,FuseSchool - Global Education,UCS3wWlfGUijnRIf745lRl2A,1529921161.0,Monoclonal Antibodies | Health | Biology | FuseSchool,"Antibodies are the warriors inside our body. They are part of our immune system, recognising and fighting against bad foreign invaders, called antigens.

Antibodies can bind to a broad range of antigens, and are produced by cells of the immune system, known as B-cells.
To learn more about antibodies and antigens, watch this video.

Antibodies can be used for medical and diagnostic applications, in the form of monoclonal antibodies.

So, what are monoclonal antibodies?

The word monoclonal means a single clone. 

Monoclonal antibodies are identical antibodies produced in laboratories from a single clone of immune cells.

The cloned immune cells are genetically completely identical. And so the antibodies they produce are also identical to one another. Which is perfect - to work properly, we need large numbers of identical antibodies.

Monoclonal antibodies have a high specificity, which means they can recognize and bind to a single antigen binding site. This means they are targeted to a specific antigen, and is a key trait that makes them useful in diagnosing and treating diseases.

So how are they produced?

Well first off we need an immune system. Which is why we use mice.

In a laboratory, a mouse is vaccinated with the target antigen. 
This stimulates the B-cells, found in the spleen, to produce antibodies against the target antigen.
The spleen of the mouse is then removed.
The B-cells in the spleen are isolated, and fused with a tumour cell. We need to fuse the antibody-producing b cells with a tumour cell, because the b-cells don’t have the ability to divide. BUT tumours however do divide easily.
This fusion cell is called a Hybridoma cell. 
The hybridoma cells reproduce rapidly to make cloned cells, which all make the same antibody.
These monoclonal antibodies are collected and purified, ready for use. They match up perfectly with the target antigens in the body. And are made in huge quantities.

Monoclonal antibodies are potentially really exciting, and can be used in a number of ways...

I bet you didn’t know antibodies were used in pregnancy tests!!

Monoclonal antibodies on the pregnancy test stick bind to the HCG hormone found in the urine of pregnant women causing a colour change.

Monoclonal antibodies can target the antigens on cancer cells and be used in a number of ways...

Firstly, by combining them with an anti-cancer drug which can then accurately locate and target only the cancer cells or avoiding the healthy cells.

Secondly for detection… they can carry special markers which show doctors where the cancerous cells are starting to build up.

Thirdly, they can be used to trigger the body’s own immune system to recognise and kill the cancer cells

They can also be used to identify other diseases and locate blood clots.

So those are a few uses… but are they all good?

We’ve seen the positives, so what are some criticisms? They are expensive and time-consuming to produce… they have more side effects than expected; and they are too specific meaning that whilst yes they can diagnose and attack diseases, they only can attack one type each time. A more diverse and adaptable solution would be better.

Correction - I made a mistake in the video. I said that sebaceous gland secretions are turned into smelly substances by bacteria and that this makes body odor. That is incorrect. That is actually true of APOCRINE gland secretions not sebaceous secretions.

4MazNT4AVms,Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy,UC1YVq-XQ8FA3-ONbi7QScHg,1521051800.0,[Webinar] Gene Therapy: A Closer Look - March 2018,"It has been thrilling to see the first Duchenne patients dosed in gene therapy, an approach that with your help PPMD has been supporting over the last years. But along with the excitement comes questions, concerns, and misunderstandings about some of the newer concepts that accompany gene therapy.

Dr. Timothy Cripe from Nationwide Children’s Hospital joined PPMD on March 14, 2018 to answer some of the questions that are top of mind for our community right now, as gene therapy trials start. The webinar covered different virus types, understanding the screening process, dosing, dystrophin constructs, promoters, and how the virus and gene that is delivered integrate into the muscle cell.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4MazNT4AVms/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-12 13:19:16.748080
jPiPJMl8Lr4,"Regis Technologies, Inc.",UCWoozfGTvm0g_o8fgZWq4cA,1455567960.0,Success Factors in Your IND Filing,"The successful filing of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) is a pivotal milestone for an emerging pharma company. This webinar is designed to address this crucial topic for the key industry segment.

Citing the FDA website for an Investigational New Drug Application, “Current Federal law requires that a drug be the subject of an approved marketing application before it is transported or distributed across state lines. Because a sponsor will probably want to ship the investigational drug to clinical investigators in many states, it must seek an exemption from that legal requirement. The IND is the means through which the sponsor technically obtains this exemption from the FDA.” This webinar is geared towards smaller pharma companies filing an IND for the first time but even experienced drug developers could benefit from an overview of the requirements and considerations. The goal of the webinar is to educate and enable our listeners in pursuit of this key objective. While this particular talk is geared towards small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and drug products, much of it applies to biologic products as well.

The Webinar features three prominent experts in the pharmaceutical development arena and each will highlight a different facet of the IND process.

Jennifer Stanek has over 20 years of experience with key roles in CMC regulatory affairs, formulation development and analytical development. She has expertise in the coordination, preparation and management of global clinical trial applications, new marketing registrations, drug master file applications and their life-cycle management. Ms. Stanek began her career at G.D. Searle, moved into CMC consulting and is currently with Takeda where she serves as Director in Global Regulatory Affairs CMC.

Jennifer will be providing an overview of the US IND format including an explanation of Modules 1-5, CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing & Controls) submission timings, FDA meetings (timing, preparation, etc), and other CMC considerations.

Dan Weissmueller is the Director of Quality at Regis Technologies. Dan’s experience and expertise include analytical development, process and analytical validation, IND support to Regis’ custom API customers, Drug Master File (DMF) regulatory approvals worldwide and FDA inspections. Dan has been with Regis for about 15 years where he has worked with numerous early phase API developments candidates and been the responsible person for the fillings of 3 approved drugs in over 20 countries. Dan is in the process of completing his Masters’ in Quality and Regulatory Sciences from Northwestern University.

Working from the perspective of a custom manufacturing organization (CMO) quality assurance director, Dan has seen both the good and bad in terms of a customer’s preparation for an IND filing. Dan will be highlighting aspects of drug substance development and cGMP scale up as it applies to the IND requirements for small molecule API’s. Topics include the development lifecycle, validation considerations, equipment qualification and risk management.

Steve Pondell brings over 30 years of experience in manufacturing and serves as Vice President of CMC at ESSA Pharmaceuticals and previously as a Principal at Integrated Biotech Solutions in Houston, Texas. Steve is a CMC expert in the manufacturing, compliance and regulatory aspects of product development from clinical manufacturing, through global regulatory approvals and into commercial production. Steve has served a variety of small to medium sized pharma and biotech companies with projects that include GMP Gap Analysis, Phase I product development programs, and cGMP compliance.

Steve will focus his talk on the IND requirements for Drug Product along with the corresponding analytical considerations. Topics include container/closure, dosage form (e.g. oral, injectable, etc), analytical method requirements, specifications, validation requirements and product stability.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jPiPJMl8Lr4/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-12 13:19:16.748080

FRq1FZgM8QA,Wyatt Technology,UCalToCmnFQNps73klap1Tdw,1536021237.0,Understanding Monoclonal Antibody Unfolding and Aggregation,"Investigations on thermal behavior are essential during the development of therapeutic proteins. Understanding the link between thermal unfolding and aggregation might help to minimize conformational and colloidal instabilities. In this study, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody (MAb) and its Fab and Fc fragments were investigated by differential scanning fluorimetry, temperature-ramped dynamic light scattering and turbidity measurement. Repulsive net charges at the low pH increased the colloidal stability, although a reduction of the conformational stability was observed. Aggregation was driven by hydrophobic interactions. Thus, the presented methods described and explained the thermal behavior of the protein and demonstrated their value for the development of pharmaceutical protein products. Coupling of differently charged hydrophobic payloads affected colloidal stability mostly based on the charge effects. The combination of orthogonal methods allows a better understanding of the conformational and colloidal stability of mAbs and mAb-conjugates.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FRq1FZgM8QA/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-12 13:19:16.748080

This week, I’m reacting to “Nurses”, a prime time NBC show about... yep, you guessed it: Nurses. Just because I work in a hospital doesn’t mean I truly understand the every day hustle of being a nurse though, so I brought on my friend Bianca Antisera, a traveling trauma nurse, to share her insight. There were a lot of puzzling choices in this pilot episode, from unethical blood donations, patient privacy violations, and the bizarre premise that everyone in a hospital is throwing shade all day long. Anything you think we missed?

Medical memes or Doctor Memes are a great way to get a laugh whether or not you are part of the medical community. I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be mean and if taken out of context can even seem rude BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. 

I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny.

NEWEST GOOD DOCTOR REVIEW: https://youtu.be/KCpWv0A5bVc

Wow! Thank you so much for supporting the Real Doctor Reacts to series. I said that if you get the grey's anatomy video to 15k likes I'll do another episode and you CRUSHED it by getting it 200k+ likes. I dove into the comments section to see what medical tv drama you wanted me to review next and it seemed like the good doctor was the obvious choice. Get ready TV Doctors, because Dr. Mike is coming for you =] 

Full disclosure, I have never watched an episode of the good doctor on ABC so I decided to go ahead and start my tv medical drama review off with the first episode ( good doctor 1x01 ) of the series. I was really curious myself to see if the good doctor is a medically accurate show.

I really did enjoy this medical tv show because I think it did a lot of things well. It gave an interesting look into what life is like a for a surgeon and a resident. Being a surgical resident is not an easy job and to make the situation even more complex Dr. Sean Murphy has autism so they did a great job of breaking down these circumstances.

I hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches The Good Doctor / Real Doctor Reacts to the Good Doctor. If you want me to continue making this tv medical drama series please like the video and leave me a comment on which medical tv show or episode you'd like for me to review next. Love you all!

Medical memes or Doctor Memes are a great way to get a laugh whether or not you are part of the medical community. I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be dark and if taken out of context can even seem offensive BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice.

If I see that you enjoyed it I will put out another post on my IG to send me the best doctor memes and nursing memes so that we can all share a laugh. #DoctorMikeMedicalMemeReview

xjhuhNKz70s,Doctor Mike,UC0QHWhjbe5fGJEPz3sVb6nw,1601486032.0,Doctor Reacts to Hilarious SNL Medical Sketches,"Saturday Night Live premieres their new season this Saturday so I decided to take a look at some of the commercial parodies they’ve done for prescription drugs. Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Dwayne The Rock Johnson… I was cracking up at these fake “direct to consumer pharmaceutical advertising” commercial parodies. Somehow the US and New Zealand are the only nations on Earth that permit this type of advertising directly people, which I think is such a strange practice. Seth Meyer’s slayed me with a sketch about a testosterone booster, Kristin Wiig cracking me up talking about having her period once a year, Chris Rock killing me complaining that he actually like Taylor Swift… SNL got these so right. Did I miss one? Let me know down in the comments if there’s another sketch you want me to look at!

I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously. If there’s a subject you want me to discuss or something you’d like for me to react to, leave a comment down below. Many of my videos have been born out of suggestions directly from you, so don’t hold back!

Brad Mondo is a fellow YouTuber, New Yorker, and hair genius. I invited him over to take a look at some of my oldest and worst haircuts. Not going to lie… Brad really let me have it. While my old looks might have needed some professional help, it turns out my hair care routine isn’t so bad! Brad reviewed how I do my hair in the morning and gave me some great tips on how to maximize my equipment and products.

As they say, there is always “truth in comedy” and these tweets were no exception. For instance, it’s true, you don’t HAVE to get weighed when you come in for a routine checkup. I also talk about sleep apnea/CPAP machines, as well as weight loss surgery. Bear popped in to say hello too   :)

Friends was one of my favorite shows growing up, so much so that I can still recite entire scenes line-for-line! I realized there were actually a TON of medical scenes throughout the series, such as Rachel AND Phoebe giving birth, Ross’ third nipple, and Joey’s kidney stones. Let’s take a look at how accurate these scenes were and see if Friends holds up 20+ years later!

Check out Medical Meme Review: https://bit.ly/314z3zN
House M.D. Reviews: https://bit.ly/2R3rhUe

In my Real Doctor vs. TV Doctor medical drama review video, I promised that if you got that video to 10,000 likes I would record myself reacting to a full grey's anatomy episode. You got it to 20,000 likes! You have spoken and I have listened. You should know that I do get the question a lot from patients as well. Is grey's anatomy accurate? So I finally decided to take a dive and find out! 

In this video, I sit down and watch the first ever Grey's Anatomy episode. Basically, a real doctor reacts to greys anatomy! I grew up watching ER and other TV medical dramas so I had a suspicion I would enjoy the show. I have to say this, greys anatomy is not medically accurate but the way it describes the characters as residents is very accurate. The hospital drama is real and I feel the show did a good job highlighting the difficulties of being a resident, inside the hospital and out. The one medical scene which totally threw me is when the surgeons automatically assumed that the seizure patient will need surgery before even coming to a diagnosis. That is not real life medicine.

It surprised me that the show is actually very entertaining and I actually enjoy the drama between McDreamy / Derek Shepherd and Meredith Grey. Apparently, TV doctors do have souls haha. The hospital romance is real! 

Get this video to 15k likes If you want me to do another doctor reacts to greys or doctor reacts to the good doctor or any other show. Please comment down below the name of your favorite show and episode. Love you all and appreciate the support!

So he got a COVID test and came to New York to hold a mock trial face to face. Med School was BRUTAL, but I never spent a moment in law school so I wasn’t sure what to expect. Devin has debunked legal misinformation from famous movies like Legally Blonde and shows like Suits, so I was in for a challenge. Needless to say, Devin brought his A-game and showed me a thing or two. What do you think? Which is harder? Let me know in the comments.

Medical memes or Doctor Memes are a great way to get a laugh whether or not you are part of the medical community. I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be mean and if taken out of context can even seem rude BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. 

I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny.

AanyHcT3aLk,Doctor Mike,UC0QHWhjbe5fGJEPz3sVb6nw,1598761547.0,Doctor Takes Personality Test | Are They Even Accurate?,"Residents in my Discord have been asking me what my Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator is, and I didn’t know! So I sat down to take a personality test inspired by the MBTI philosophy and was… surprised by my results. There are several scientific problems with these tests which should prevent them from ever being used in making a major life decision. Some companies actually use these things to hire employees and structure their business, and that’s not something I can endorse. That being said, these tests are very fun and can be entertaining to take with friends or even provide you with some introspection if done with a professional. Let me know what personality type you are down in the comments!

I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously. If there’s a subject you want me to discuss or something you’d like for me to react to, leave a comment down below. Many of my videos have been born out of suggestions directly from you, so don’t hold back!

Sunscreen, swimsuits, football head injuries (concussions/CTE), dogs and babies… the doctors on Reddit have strong takes on all of these things and so much more. I decided to look at a thread about practices medical professionals have started based upon things they’ve learned from their patients. Some of the advice is good, such as having an up-to-date will and the benefits of quitting smoking. Other things, such as making sure you pee before you get inside ANY car… are a little too much for me. At the end I also share 3 ways I’ve changed my life based on my interactions with patients, including thoughts on skin cancer and coffee and alcohol consumption. Let me know down below if you think any of these will change the way you go about your daily life!

Check out the rest of the thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/gkv1x8/as_an_orthopedic_surgeon_i_will_never_ride_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x

XtvauVV0XY8,Doctor Mike,UC0QHWhjbe5fGJEPz3sVb6nw,1594826840.0,My Response To Fatphobia Claims,"I was scrolling through reddit today and came across this post saying I have “fatphobic tendencies”. This was really hard for me to read and caused me to take a critical look back at my previous comments regarding obesity, bariatric treatments, and diet recommendations (Keto, intermittent fasting, vegan, etc.) Our culture demonizes people for their weight, from rogue marketing pushing “ideal bodies” in media to a lack of representation for large bodied people on stage and on screen. That being said, I am a doctor, and my job is to help people live longer, healthier lives, and often those results can be achieved through a variety of tactics that will reduce the weight of people who suffer from obesity. It’s a fine line between helping my patients and making sure they don’t feel judged or criticized for the way they look, and I’m working hard to get it right.

https://www.patreon.com/doctormike

I can’t quite believe it myself, but it’s true: 3 years on YouTube, 6 million subscribers, and over 600 million total views. While I might be the face you see when you watch a Doctor Mike video, I want you all to know that I’m not the only one who makes this thing happen. My shooter/editor, Dan Owens (@DanOwensCreative on IG) has been with me from day one and I truly couldn’t have done this without him. To celebrate the last 3 years and announce our Patreon venture, I sat down with Dan to play a version of the Newlywed Game where we reminisced about everything that’s happened over the last 3 years. Thank you, Dan!!!

I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously. If there’s a subject you want me to discuss or something you’d like for me to react to, leave a comment down below. Many of my videos have been born out of suggestions directly from you, so don’t hold back!

Well, this flight was exciting, to say the least! Luckily it was a learning experience for both me and Matt! Whenever you have an airplane medical emergency doctors do have an ethical but no legal obligation to help. After this event, I thought it might be nice to do a dedicated video to Airplane Medical Emergencies and in general what is expected of doctors and passengers. If you're game for that please let me know in the comments!

Dr. Youn,"A few weeks ago I reacted to some TikToks and you were quick to point out that I featured one from Dr. Anthony Youn, a new YouTuber who’s been teaching us a lot about Plastic Surgery. I decided to invite Dr. Youn on my channel so we could dive into Google and demystify the practice, from sagging of breast augmentation to the controversy surrounding collagen. I learned a lot, including the fact that there are plastic surgeons who operate on dogs and cats! Maybe it’s time for Bear to get a facelift…

I thought I’d dive into the game, poke around for 30 minutes, and I’d have quickly climbed the ranks to become a doctor. As anyone who has played Sims 4 before will tell you, I was sadly mistaken. Today I asked the hilarious Kelsey Impicciche, a Sims 4 pro, to show me the ropes and help get my house in order (literally). She showed how to create my dog, Bear, dress my Sim for success, and be somewhat functional in the hospital. I promise I’m a better doctor in real life! Get this video to 100,000 likes and I promise to upload myself AND Bear to the Sims server so you can use US in your game  :)

You need to face your fears and step out of your comfort zone to succeed and be happy + healthy. So this week I jumped into a cockpit of a plane, played with scorpions, and looked super silly on the golf course. 

I hope you guys can tell I'm super nervous throughout this video because I am truly afraid of all of these tasks. I also have to give a huge thank you to the folks at Kissimmee Florida for organizing all of these amazing activities for me and letting me conquer my fears all in one weekend!!! I put links down below for all of the activists you saw in this video so you too can reap the benefits of stepping outside of your comfort zone. 

Leave me a comment down below of your biggest fears and share your stories of how you’ve conquered them!

This one is called ""disgusting science"" where you make slime snot, stomach simulations, and more! 

I would give this kit 3.5/5 stars as it does a great job of teaching basic science/health concepts through the activities and even has solid explanations. However, the kit has few tools and you need A LOT of supplemental equipment like bread, vinegar, containers, etc. If you are looking to learn some basic health and have some laughs making slime through science this can be a good kit for you to check out. 

Ari and I definitely shared more than one laugh on this simple science experiment. As they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together!

Plot summary fro Netflix:
Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) has it all. She's the President of her sorority, a Hawaiian Tropic girl, Miss June in her campus calendar, and, above all, a natural blonde. She dates the cutest fraternity boy on campus and wants nothing more than to be Mrs. Warner Huntington III. But, there's just one thing stopping Warner (Matthew Davis) from popping the question: Elle is too blonde. Growing up across the street from Aaron Spelling might mean something in Los Angeles, California, but nothing to Warner's East-Coast blue blood family. So, when Warner packs up for Harvard Law and reunites with an old sweetheart from prep school, Elle rallies all her resources and gets into Harvard, determined to win him back. But law school is a far cry from the comforts of her poolside and the mall. Elle must wage the battle of her life, for her guy, for herself and for all the blondes who suffer endless indignities everyday.

I get asked a lot about whether being a practicing attorney is like being a lawyer on TV.  I love watching legal movies and courtroom dramas.  It's one of the reasons I decided to become a lawyer.  But sometimes they make me want to pull my hair out because they are ridiculous.  Today I'm taking a break from representing clients and teaching law students how to kick ass in law school to take on lawyers in the movies and on TV.  While all legal movies and shows take dramatic license to make things more interesting (nobody wants to see hundreds of hours of brief writing), many of them have a grain of truth.  This is part of a continuing series of ""Lawyer Reaction"" videos.  Got a legal movie or TV show you'd like me to critique?  Let me know in the comments!  

Typical legal disclaimer from a lawyer (occupational hazard):  This is not legal advice, nor can I give you legal advice.  Sorry!  Everything here is for informational purposes only and not for the purpose of providing legal advice. You should contact your attorney to obtain advice with respect to any particular issue or problem.  Nothing here should be construed to form an attorney client relationship.  Also, some of the links in this post may be affiliate links, meaning, at no cost to you, I will earn a small commission if you click through and make a purchase.

Being the brilliant mortician she is, I thought it would make a lot of sense for us to not react to a medical drama, but a death drama, so we watched HBO’s Six Feet Under. Despite my years of medical training and experience, there isn’t a lot I know about what happens to the human body after it dies, so Caitlin enlightened me to things such as what happens to prosthetics, the smells of a mortuary, and what happens to your various orifices.

I invited my friends Pam and Cody over to see if they could tell the difference between the food I cooked MYSELF, or food I bought from the supermarket. They’re both comedians AND foodies, so I knew I had my work cut out for me if I was going to beat the supermarket! I made five dishes: turkey burgers, peanut butter and jelly balls, green goddess salad, pesto pasta, and granola bars. The winner actually walked away with a brand new Vitamix A3500 12-Cup Food Processor Attachment with SELF-DETECT, which I used to make every dish. Let me know which one looked tastiest to you :)

Y6uBnzU5ebE,Doctor Mike,UC0QHWhjbe5fGJEPz3sVb6nw,1597249996.0,Doctor Plays Really Bad Medical Games 👎🏼 😂,"Last year I played some of the worst medical games on the App Store. Turns out that since then, the bar has been lowered. I dove back into the maddening world of mobile medical games and was GREATLY disappointed in the results. Using steroid cremes to treat pustules, force-feeding cheeseburgers to children, rubbing a pirates stomach to alleviate gas? None of this is medically accurate. Also, why so many ads for malpractice lawyers? Are the children playing these games REALLY seeking legal representation?? WHO MADE THESE??

It's pretty funny because technically I am a TV doctor because I work in news but I hope to you it's clear I am referring to fictional tv doctors! 


If you watch until the end you’ll know that I have never watched a full Grey’s Anatomy episode and if you guys get this video to 10k likes, I will watch a full episode and record my reactions as a stand-alone YT video! I'll call it Real Doctor Watches Grey's Anatomy! Now go smash those like and share buttons!!! Also, don’t forget that I will be doing a monthly video reading the comments you leave so go ahead, jump into the comments section. Love you all!

WELCOME TO MEDICAL MEME REVIEW EP 5!!!! 

Medical memes or Doctor Memes are a great way to get a laugh whether or not you are part of the medical community. I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be dark and if taken out of context can even seem offensive BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. 

I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny. Please if you enjoy this series let me know by liking, commenting, and sharing this video with your friends/family. If I see that you enjoyed it I will put out another post on my IG to send me the best doctor memes and nursing memes so that we can all share a laugh. #DoctorMikeMedicalMemeReview

As they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together! 

If you have an idea of something you want me to cover in depth, please let me know because I take your requests seriously. We will be back with more Medical Drama Review Series in a couple of weeks so please submit more names of shows/episodes you'd like for me to watch. Love you all!

RFRN1WY98Ik,Doctor Mike,UC0QHWhjbe5fGJEPz3sVb6nw,1524384546.0,Real Doctor Reacts to HOUSE M.D. | Medical Drama Review | Doctor Mike,"Once again I dove into the comments section to see what medical tv drama you wanted me to review next and it seemed like Dr. House or House M.D. was the next most popular choice. Get ready TV Doctors, because Dr. Mike is coming for you =] 

Full disclosure, I have watched a few episodes of House before but this was probably 10 years ago so I decided to go ahead and start this tv medical drama review off with the first episode ( House MD episode 1 ) of the series. I was really curious to see the difference in watching the show now that I am a licensed doctor. The last time I watched the program I was in high school and knew a tenth of the medical knowledge I know now! 

Honestly, I love this medical tv show series because I think it allows us to laugh at some of the crazy situations Hugh Laurie gets himself into. Plus It gave an interesting look at what life is like as an infectious disease doctor especially one as highly regarded as Dr. House. Obviously, the way that he practices medicine is not realistic or accurate because we don't break into people's homes nor do we treat them without explaining what we are doing. All in all, I think Dr. House is a must watch tv show if you're into medical dramas just for laughs alone.

I hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches House M.D. / Real Doctor Reacts to House M.D. If you want me to continue making this series please like the video and leave me a comment on which show or episode you'd like for me to review next. Love you all!

Please if you enjoy this series let me know by liking, commenting, and sharing this video with your friends/family. If I see that you enjoyed it I will put out another post on my IG to send me the best doctor memes and nursing memes so that we can all share a laugh. 

As they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together! 

If you have an idea of something you want me to cover in depth, please let me know because I take your requests seriously. We will be back with more Medical Drama Review Series in a couple of weeks so please submit more names of shows/episodes you'd like for me to watch. Love you all!

I quizzed her on which diseases were real and which were fake, and if she could get it right then I’d donate $100 to the charity of her choice, the St. Baldrick’s Foundation. Here’s the catch: literally every disease I quizzed her on is fake, having all come from movies and TV shows. Pam was squirming back and forth trying to figure out if diseases from Pokemon, Contagion, Spongebob Squarepants, Batman, The Simpsons, and countless other programs were real. I followed it up with some real things in medicine that sound fake but aren’t.

I wanted to watch the first episode of season one but I couldn't find it streaming anywhere, so I watched the first episode of season 5. 

Please comment down below if you want more of this show or comment which show you want next! Also, turn on the notification bell to ""ALL"" alerts so that you can be notified when I drop the good stuff =] 

Check out the show here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=EL00J1lDEUQbavKIkU9XQPRg

Anyway, I hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches Untold Stories of The ER / Real Doctor Reacts to Untold Stories of the ER . If you want me to continue making this doctor reaction video please give it a  like and leave me a comment on which tv drama or show you'd like for me to review next. Love you all!

Check me out in the hospital: https://youtu.be/LzpCldPiT0c

WELCOME TO MEDICAL MEME REVIEW EP 8!!! 

Medical memes or Doctor Memes are a great way to get a laugh whether or not you are part of the medical community. I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be dark and if taken out of context can even seem offensive BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. 

I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny. Please if you enjoy this series let me know by liking, commenting, and sharing this video with your friends/family. If I see that you enjoyed it I will put out another post on my IG to send me the best doctor memes and nursing memes so that we can all share a laugh. #DoctorMikeMedicalMemeReview

As they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together! 

If you have an idea of something you want me to cover in-depth, please let me know because I take your requests seriously. We will be back with more Medical Drama Review Series in a couple of weeks so please submit more names of shows/episodes you'd like for me to watch. Love you all!

In partnership with Fox's medical show The Resident, I visited the set, interviewed Manish Dayal, and even tried my hand at auditioning with a pro actor. 

You know that I've been watching a lot of medical dramas lately so going behind the scenes of a major show was very very cool. I got to review the set and see how they basically built a full hospital within a warehouse! The scale of what they are able to accomplish for these shows is truly impressive.

Please let me know if you enjoyed this type of video with a comment and a like so that we can continue to make more unique and fun content every Sunday morning at 11am EST!

 Love you all! 

Make sure to Tune in Monday 9/24 at 8/7c on FOX for the seasons two premiere of the show.

This video, created by Nucleus Medical Media, shows the two types of dialysis procedures for removing waste and excess fluid in the body when the kidneys stop functioning properly. Dialysis can also be done to treat acute kidney failure or to remove drugs or poisons from the body. In one type of dialysis, called hemodialysis, a dialyzer machine is used to clean the blood outside the body. In a peritoneal dialysis, the membranes lining the abdomen and intestines, called the peritoneum, is used to clean the blood without removing it from the body.

Plasmids are circular DNA constructs which may encode instructions for the synthesis of an engineered protein by the desired host cells.  Following transformation and selection of bacterial colonies containing the plasmid, the recombinant protein is expressed and purified.  Poly-histidine tagging and Nickel ion chromatography are commonly used to isolate large quantities of highly-purified target proteins.  This video will demonstrate the procedures involved, including expression of a His-tagged recombinant protein in bacteria, purification of the protein using Nickel ion affinity chromatography, and analysis using SDS-PAGE.

Learn how animal physiology researchers at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg use the ChemiDoc MP imaging system to investigate the basic molecular mechanisms of vision. The ChemiDoc MP system enables stain-free imaging with superior sensitivity, exceptional image quality, and outstanding versatility. 

Graduate student Johanna Mühlhans uses the ChemiDoc MP system to quantitate protein expression during various phases of retinal development in mouse eyes. She likens the multiplexing capabilities of the ChemiDoc MP system, which allows the visualization of multiple proteins simultaneously in a single sample with different fluorophores, to the evolutionary development of color vision in mammalian eyes — a great step forward. Mühlhans relates how this system allows her to display all the proteins of interest in a given experiment in a single lane of a western blot, greatly accelerating her research.

This 3D medical animation, created by Nucleus Medical Media, depicts a minimally invasive direct anterior total hip replacement (THR) of the right hip. An overview of the hip anatomy and pathology are presented along with the surgical risks and benefits. This procedure is usually done when severe damage from arthritis or injury has made it difficult to perform daily activities without severe pain or restricted range of motion. A THR may include the use of a specialized table and fluoroscopy machine. The incision, exposure of the hip joint, placement of the acetabular hip prosthetic component (socket), removal of the arthritic femoral head, and placement of the femoral head prosthesis (ball) are also demonstrated.

P2tN68Gkg5w,The Lallantop,UCx8Z14PpntdaxCt2hakbQLQ,1607854537.0,Farmers Protest Documentary | Singhu Border | The Lallantop | Farm Bills | किसान आंदोलन | Rajat Sain,"The Lallantop presents to you this film named ""Kisaan Anndolan"" by Rajat Sain and Roohani. The film looks at the ongoing Indian farmers' protest. 
The farmers have been protesting against the three farm acts passed by the parliament in 2020. The protest took various turns where the farmers were also labelled as Khalistani by Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar. Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut also got into a war of words on Twitter with Singer/Actor Diljit Dosanjh over her comment on the old woman in a viral video from the protest being the famous Bilquees Dadi from Shaheen Bagh.

Over 500 farmer unions are protesting. Transport unions representing over 14 million truckers, bus drivers, and taxi drivers have come out in support of the farmers, threatening to halt movement of supplies in certain states. Farmers from Punjab, Haryana, UP, Gujarat are participating in the protest. The Centre is making constant efforts to find a solution to the issue. However, protesting farmers do not seem to be in a hurry. Farmers protesting at the Singhu Border are running langars and have claimed that they are carrying ration which can last them up to six months. Amid a lot of things, the protest also saw a demand for Haryana Dy CM Dushyant Chautala's resignation. We here have tried to bring to you our coverage from the Singhu border which was almost shot over a span of 48 hours. 

The Lallantop is closely covering the #FarmersProtest happening in and around Delhi. Farmers unions are demanding from the union government to roll back the newly enacted farm act, 2020, amendments in the electricity act, 2003 and ordinance for air quality management in NCR+ region. Farmers' unions are claiming that these are anti-people, anti-farming laws which must be repealed immediately. Whereas, Govt- right from the PM Narendra Modi to HM Amit Shah, RM Rajnath Singh and Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar are giving assurance to farmers and are stating that 'these acts are for the betterment of farmers and farming.'

About Video :- 
It has been informed that the remains of PNS Ghazi, the first fast-attack submarine of Pakistan Navy, discovered in the waters of Visakhapatnam, might soon be turned into a tourist attraction in the city. The submarine, which was Pakistan’s flagship underwater vessel, took part in several wars including the Indo-Pak war in 1971, during which the submarine sank in the waters near the Visakhapatnam harbour. Historians claim the sinking of Ghazi to be a notable event and as one of the biggest mysteries of the 1971 war with Indian and Pakistan sources having different views behind the reason for its sinking. ""PNS Ghazi has been located near the entrance of the city’s port, at a depth of 28m from the sea surface. While the divers of Indian Navy have been conducting regular dives here, further details are yet to be studied. We need to discuss with the concerned authorities and decide how to take this further and help Vizag gain another feather in its cap of the tourism industry.” What does PNS Ghazi hold for Vizag.
Indo-Pakistani relations deteriorated again when civil war erupted in Pakistan, pitting the West Pakistan army against East Pakistanis demanding autonomy and later independence. The fighting forced an estimated 10 million East Pakistani civilians to flee to India. In December India invaded East Pakistan in support of the East Pakistani people. The Indian army proved too strong for Pakistani army as a result of which, Pakistani army surrendered at Dhaka and its army of more than 90,000 became Indian prisoners of war. East Pakistan became the independent country of Bangladesh on 6 December 1971. Regional tensions were reduced by the Simla accord of 1972 and by Pakistan's recognition of Bangladesh in 1974.
1971 indo Pak War Battle of Longewallah Rare footage 1971 Indo Pak War vintage video The Battle of Longewala (4–7 December 1971) was one of the first major engagements in the western sector during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, fought between assaulting Pakistani forces and Indian defenders at the Indian border post of Longewala, in the Thar Desert of Rajasthan state in India.
Battle of Longewala 1971, border post of Laungewala, in the Thar Desert of Rajasthan state in India. It was Indian Army's 23rd battalion, Punjab Regiment, commanded by Major Kuldip Singh Chandpuri. Being outnumbered by the approaching Pakistani troops who were 2000 in numbers comparing with a small number of 200. Major Kuldip Chandpuri decided to fight while asking for reinforcement. Reinforcement in the form of Airforce was only only possible next day and until then Major Kuldip Chandpuri and his team had to tactfully face the enemy army. Lance Naik Mathura Das of 23rd Punjab Regiment, Indian Armed Forces, with the help of R C L jeep destroyed amny of the enemy tanks boosting the morale of the force. Using all his years of experience he tactfully kept the Pakistani army baffled thinking that the Indian troops were in large number. Next day Airforce took in air and managed to hit the enemy troops who were so confused that they lost the plot and fled the battlefield leaving behind their tanks and trucks. Pakistan tanks and trucks are now on display at Laungewala and in a museum outside Jaisalmer in Rajasthan of India. Major Kuldip Chanduri was honoured with the highest accolade, Maha Vir Chakra and other army members also honoured.
Bangladesh Liberation War 1971: Freedom's Arms It was truly a fight between the David and the Goliath in 1971. The Mukti Bahini fighters fought the war with a motley collection of age old and tattered arms against the mighty Pakistan army, supposedly one of the best at that time.

lhjGjk0Xp1A,The Lallantop,UCx8Z14PpntdaxCt2hakbQLQ,1606998058.0,"#FarmersProtest: किसान आंदोलन में आए student ने Farm Act 2020, Electricity bill की पोल-पट्टी खोल दी","The Lallantop is closely covering the Farmers protest happening in and around Delhi. Farmers unions are demanding from the union government to roll back the newly enacted farm act, 2020, amendments in the electricity act, 2003 and ordinance for air quality management in NCR+ region. Farmers' unions are claiming that these are anti-people, anti-farming laws which must be repealed immediately. Whereas, Govt- right from the PM Narendra Modi to HM Amit Shah, RM Rajnath Singh and Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar are giving assurance to farmers and are stating that 'these acts are for the betterment of farmers and farming.'
Many students have joined the farmers at the protest site Singhu border of Haryana and Delhi, near Kundli, Sonipat. The Lallantop asked a student leader Ramanpreet associated with Chandigarh based students' organization 'Students for society' to share their reservations about these acts and why they are not convinced with the assurance given by the prime minister and the cabinet ministers? Ramanpreet also answered the question related to anarchical behaviour, alleged Khalistani link, funding, preparation, the social and political aspect of this mass protest happening at the edge of Delhi. Do watch and share your opinion with us, what you think about these laws?

""Hypersensitivity reactions are exaggerated or inappropriate immune response to benign antigens. It is the immune response and not the antigen that is harmful. An external antigen such as a drug, pollen or food can elicit an inappropriate immune response.

Hypersensitivity Type I is a antibody mediated reaction. It is also called the immediate hypersensitivity reaction because it is fast. An allergic reaction is a type I hypersensitivity reaction and really involves recognition of an antigen by primed IgE immunoglobulins on mast cells.""

""Type III hypersensitivity also known as immune complex hypersensitivity reaction. Is a reaction where formation of the antigen-antibody complexes deposit in tissues activating complement proteins and so the inflammatory response in tissues.

The antigen antibody complex are the immune complexes and these will circulate around the body. The immune complexes can be cleared by macrophages in the spleen or liver, but when not cleared immune complexes will deposit into various tissues, where they induce complement activation. Complement proteins are circulating protein which when active trigger a cascade of activating other complement proteins promoting the immune response and inflammation.""

Following is a transcript of the video:

Narrator: We've all been there. The loaf of bread you bought a couple weeks ago is starting to grow mold and you're wondering ""Maybe I can just cut the part where I can see the mold and eat the clean part."" It turns out, even though you cannot see it, your whole loaf of bread could be teaming with fungus. Following is a transcript of the video.

You're all ready to make the sandwich of your dreams. Turkey, tomato, and swiss on a bed of romaine lettuce sandwiched between two slices of sourdough. Classic.

Oh no, what's this? Mold? But look, good new. The mold's only on part of the bread. So, I can just cut that away and be fine, right?

There's no such thing as a ""clean"" part of moldy bread. That's because mold is a fungus, like mushrooms. The caps on the surface are easy enough to spot. But there's a vast network of subterranean ""roots"" called hyphae that you can't see.

So let's take another look at that bread of yours. Ugh, disgusting!

Maybe you can just grab another piece from the same loaf. Well, that's not such a great idea, either. Because by the time mold sprouts its fuzzy head, what you're really seeing is the reproductive part of the mold called sporangiums. Each sporangium releases tens of thousands of spores.

So, even though you can't see it, that entire loaf could be teeming with fungus.

But it seems like such a waste to just throw it out. After all, you eat mold on purpose all the time, like the mold that goes into making cheese, soy sauce, and even life-saving antibiotics, like penicillin. Eating a little bit on your bread can't be that bad, right?

Ultimately, it's a gamble. Just like eating a wild mushroom, many are fine. But some can be deadly.

Mold is the same way. There are thousands of different species of mold — many of which are harmless to humans. But since so many types can sprout up on food it's nearly impossible to know if what you're eating is safe.

Cladosporium, for example, can sometimes trigger allergies but is generally harmless. Whereas other molds, like Penicillium crustosum, produce harmful poisons called mycotoxins. An elderly couple in 2005, for example, was admitted to the hospital after eating a can of soup contaminated with this kind of mold. They had severe muscle tremors but eventually recovered.

But other molds, like Rhizopus stolonifer, can have permanent effects. And you might recognize this mold since it commonly grows on bread: blue-green, with black splotches, and super fuzzy. In rare cases, it can prompt a deadly infection called Zygomycosis, which causes your blood to clot and can, ultimately, starve your cells of oxygen to the point that they die.

And it's not like bacteria where a little heat will eliminate the threat because high temperatures won't break down the mycotoxins. And since you have no clue which one you're about to put in your mouth, ask yourself: Is it really worth the risk?",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4ro8sPOgCBg/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-13 18:53:59.901994

If we drink water beyond the processing capabilities of our kidneys, then they are not able to eliminate the excess water. As a result, water level increases in our blood and sodium level goes down. This condition is known as hyponatremia or water intoxication.

Sodium is an essential electrolyte which balances fluids inside and outside our cells. The imbalance caused by water level going up and sodium level going down causes the fluids outside our cells to move inside. As a result, our cells begin to swell. This swelling can cause multiple health problems. Also, if swelling takes place in our brain cells, then we can get headaches or nausea. This condition can also prove to be fatal.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/siern7ftofk/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-13 18:53:59.901994

uKzeBikWbvs,Hussain Biology,UCDCg5AAslixldHh5D7Nu6-g,1564472744.0,Complement System |  Classical Pathway,"The complement system is a part of the immune system that enhances (complements) the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear microbes and damaged cells from an organism, promote inflammation, and attack the pathogen's cell membrane. It is part of the innate immune system, which is not adaptable and does not change during an individual's lifetime. The complement system can, however, be recruited and brought into action by antibodies generated by the adaptive immune system.
The complement system consists of a number of small proteins that are synthesized by the liver, and circulate in the blood as inactive precursors. When stimulated by one of several triggers, proteases in the system cleave specific proteins to release cytokines and initiate an amplifying cascade of further cleavages.
Most of the proteins and glycoproteins that constitute the complement system are synthesized by hepatocytes. But significant amounts are also produced by tissue macrophages, blood monocytes, and epithelial cells of the genitourinary system and gastrointestinal tract. The three pathways of activation all generate homologous variants of the protease C3-convertase. The classical complement pathway typically requires antigen-antibody complexes for activation (specific immune response), whereas the alternative pathway can be activated by spontaneous complement component 3 (C3) hydrolysis, foreign material, pathogens, or damaged cells. The mannose-binding lectin pathway can be activated by C3 hydrolysis or antigens without the presence of antibodies (non-specific immune response). In all three pathways, C3-convertase cleaves and activates component C3, creating C3a and C3b, and causes a cascade of further cleavage and activation events. C3b binds to the surface of pathogens, leading to greater internalization by phagocytic cells by opsonization.

The classical pathway is triggered by activation of the C1-complex. The C1-complex is composed of 1 molecule of C1q, 2 molecules of C1r and 2 molecules of C1s, or C1qr2s2. This occurs when C1q binds to IgM or IgG complexed with antigens. A single pentameric IgM can initiate the pathway, while several, ideally six, IgGs are needed. This also occurs when C1q binds directly to the surface of the pathogen. Such binding leads to conformational changes in the C1q molecule, which leads to the activation of two C1r molecules. C1r is a serine protease. They then cleave C1s (another serine protease). The C1r2s2 component now splits C4 and then C2, producing C4a, C4b, C2a, and C2b (historically, the larger fragment of C2 was called C2a but is now referred to as C2b). C4b and C2b bind to form the classical pathway C3-convertase (C4b2b complex), which promotes cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b. C3b later joins with C4b2b to make C5 convertase (C4b2b3b complex).",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uKzeBikWbvs/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-13 18:54:00.499972

There sure are a LOT of weight management tips across the internet, and after my research it appears finding the facts from trustworthy sources is harder than it seems. Heck, I’m a doctor and had trouble verifying a lot of this stuff, so how is someone without a medical degree supposed to find accurate and safe info? Today I’m taking a look at some popular weight loss tips around the internet to tell you what’s real and and what’s not.

I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously. If there’s a subject you want me to discuss or something you’d like for me to react to, leave a comment down below. Many of my videos have been born out of suggestions directly from you, so don’t hold back!

But at times, they also confuse intolerances with allergies. I decided to sit down with a leading pediatric allergist Dr. Dave Stukus and chat all things allergy.

안녕하세요. 루루팡입니다.
이번에 새로운 스타일의 영상을 시도해봤어요. 
노래도 직접 리믹스하고, 애니메이션까지 제작하다 보니 시간이 정말 많이 들었어요 ㅠㅠ 
평소와 다른 어두운 주제의 영상에 실망하셨다면 죄송합니다.
처음 시도 한 것들이라 서툴지만 열심히 만들었어요.
노래의 원곡은 틱톡에서 활동하시는 Lynlapid 님의 Producer man 이며
스토리는 틱톡 Matiland_mati 님의 영상을 참고했습니다. 
스토리 사용을 허락해주신 마티님과, 노래 사용을 허락주신 Lyn님께 감사드립니다!

백만명기념 이벤트 계획이 조금 미뤄졌습니다ㅠㅠ 9월 중순쯤에 이벤트 내용이 업로드 될 예정이에요.
기다려주신 분들께 죄송하고 감사합니다.

오늘도 제 채널에 들러 주셔서 감사합니다. 앞으로도 잘 부탁드려요.

More About Teeth: 
Things of worth are often neglected in favour of that which might be more immediately gratifying. Unfortunately, the things that are neglected are often lost forever, irreplaceable. This is the story of a man with a misguided and intense focus – one which started in his youth and carried on to old age. His life events are chronicled through the loss of his teeth – and how his obsessive efforts to amend what was damaged bring on yet further destruction

In a strange, dark box lives a group of box-headed elderly humanoid creatures with roots instead of legs. Most of these creatures are sunken into a catatonic sleep, unaware of anything outside their hermetic, sealed-off world.

But one of them emerges from the crowd, stunned into consciousness. Young and growing, the creature starts to cause a joyful ruckus, but struggles against the disapproval and rancor of the rest of his box-dwellers. But then the youngster begins to fight back, looking for a way outside the box but coming against its most oppressive forces yet.

Writer/director/animator Dusan Kastelic's short animation is a surreal yet exuberant allegory about the pleasures and perils of non-conformity, being an individual and pushing through obstacles to a new level of consciousness.

The narrative takes the phrase ""outside the box"" and spins it into a deeply imaginative, hypnotic narrative that resembles a fairy tale. Not a sanitized children's version of a fairy tale, however: the film instead resembles the original European fairy stories, which were dark, psychologically complex and disquieting in their emotional violence.

The images are nightmarish, with their evocations of distorted flesh and murky colors. But the expressiveness of the creatures and attention to detail -- created in open-source 3-D software Blender -- are remarkable from a technical and emotional level, and draw in viewers with a powerful combination of gesture, sound and storytelling.

Despite the claustrophobic world portrayed in the film, there are splashes of zany humor and joy, particularly as the younger creature expresses its unbridled childlike self. The musical score and sound design by Mateja Staric go a long way to create contrast between stultifying conformity and youthful individualism, as well as keeping the narrative at a consistently engaging pace.

Despite its strange appearance, the uninhibited joyousness and high spirits of the newly emergent creature are so much like the energy of children, and viewers cannot help but relate. Yet ""The Box"" becomes genuinely sad and painful as the youngster is repeatedly brought down and cut down to size, and confronts the mechanisms of the box itself that keep its inhabitants docile and in the dark.

Watching that struggle becomes a powerful metaphor for the oppression and conformity that we all face, whether it's the box that society puts us inside or the ones we put ourselves in. To watch the creature struggle against a dark, narrow world is hard, and yet, as the creature discovers, as long as you can feel a spark of an essential self, there is always a way towards the light.

It’s one reason global chains have struggled to grow in Vietnam’s more than $1 billion market for specialty coffee and tea shops.

Are you immune to the COVID-19 virus without even having it? Let us talk about the very real possibility of this.  Coronaviruses are some of the viruses that cause the common cold. Many people have been exposed to these viruses in the past. Will this mean that there will be some degree of immunity to COVID-19 because people have had exposure? Let us find out. I will review a recent study looking at T cell recognition of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19, in patients who have never had the virus. At the end of the video 5:28 there is a short segment on a hamster mask study you will not want to miss!

I was privileged to travel to the Kennedy Space Center, to watch the launch of Atlantis, on what was then, the final ""scheduled"" flight of the orbiter (STS-132).  This video is my homage to the shuttle program, through the in depth experience of a single orbiter launch. I believe we should be thankful for the Atlantis orbiter, all her astronauts, the countless NASA staff who made her fly, and the American people who created a space vehicle of extraordinary power and grace.

This footage incorporates numerous camera views from the ground, footage I took during launch, and video and audio from NASA showing the orbiter stack itself, during takeoff and flight -- in order to experiencing the all the preparation and the resulting eight and a half minute exhilarating ride into space.

In places, the timeline of the actual events has been extended slightly to allow us to see different viewpoints of the same moment, and better experience the amazing feat of launching a spacecraft into orbit.

Enjoy the ride!


MORE BACKGROUND
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After this flight, Atlantis was processed and prepared to fly one last time...  this time as ""on call"" STS-335, which would remain flight ready, should either of the remaining two orbiters flights require a rescue mission.

A rescue flight was not needed and Congress, in a rare moment of clarity, appropriated enough money to extend the program to allowed the already ""flight ready"" Atlantis to launch one last time and to become the last shuttle mission of the Shuttle Program, as STS-135.

Atlantis now has a home at the Kennedy Space Center.

Orbits of Planets as well as Comets will be significantly altered. Initially comets and meteorites might start hurtling towards us. Later even the planets might start colliding with each other.
Secondly, even if a gigantic planet like Jupiter comes in the path of the Black hole it will be devoured.
Thirdly, if the Black hole comes near Earth, initially its intense gravitational pull will cause devastating earthquakes and volcanoes. When the Black hole reaches our orbit there will be nothing left but an uninhabitable magma-laden rock.
Lastly, our Sun might offer some resistance to start with. A gravitational tug of war might ensue. But eventually even our beloved Sun will be ripped apart to pieces.

There are eight planets in our solar system 
We all revolve around the sun
Learn about the different planets
Now sing along and have some fun

My name is Mercury
I’m the second hottest planet
The closest one to the sun
A year on my surface is 88 days
I’m the smallest but I’m lots of fun

My name is Venus
I’m the hottest planet 
But the second planet from the sun
I’m the brightest planet in our solar system
And I’m too hot for anyone

My name is Earth
I’m the planet you live on 
The Third Planet from the sun
I’m the only planet with organic life
So take care of me because we’re all one

My name is mars
I am red in color 
The fourth planet from the sun
I have the highest mountain in our solar system
A volcano named Olympus Mons

There are eight planets in our solar system 
We all revolve around the sun
Learn about the different planets
Now sing along and have some fun

My name is Jupiter I am covered in clouds
I’m the fifth planet from the sun
My giant red spot is a raging storm 
As for size, I’m the biggest one

My name is Saturn I am brown in color
I’m the sixth planet from the sun 
My outer rings are extremely thin
They’re made of dust and icy chunks 

My names Uranus I am blue in color 
I’m the seventh planet from the sun
Humans have named me the icy planet 
Because I am the coldest one

My name is Neptune I am blue in color 
I’m the eighth planet from the sun
I have too many storms in my atmosphere 
And I’m the furthest planet from the sun 

There are eight planets in our solar system 
We all revolve around the sun
Learn about the different planets
Now sing along and have some fun

GoW8Tf7hTGA,morn1415,UC8w7ynzLYXpRbPrfpDbMHlw,1469999918.0,Star Size Comparison 2,"Dear world,
Let´s talk about time.
When I uploaded my first YouTube video 7 years ago, I would have never thought that it would get that much attention. Had lots of discussions, met new people, continued to make videos about things that intrigued me. Or tried out effects.

I enjoyed it a lot, and I still read every comment that pops up. And they keep coming in. It is a hobby that I am very glad about having started. And I am humbled by the attention.
 
Well, as time went by I found less time to work on videos, struggled with other things in life, and wondered if I would ever find the time again.

But I always knew one thing:
I owe you something. All the time people were are asking about a sequel to starsize comparison. And yes, I promised once.
I keep my promises. So, whenever I found time over the last year I spent it on that. Here it is.
I hope you like it. I tried to do it in a bit different way. Curious for the feedback. I know I will be hardly able to beat the choice of music from the first part, but let me say, Vangelis Alpha is a piece that is very dear to my heart, I always had this in mind.
Still looking for contact to musicians.
I do not know what the future brings, but I hope we will hear from each other. Enjoy.

Lyrics:
We all come from a place
The entire human race
Depends upon our planet
Racing through outer space 
And there are eight planets
That orbit around the sun
Come on, we’ll introduce you
And name them one by one:

Chorus
Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars
Jupiter, Saturn
Uranus, Neptune

Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars
Jupiter, Saturn
Uranus, Neptune

Mercury:
I’m Mercury, the smallest planet, you see
You humans could never live on me
My atmosphere’s too thin, and I orbit too fast
My days are long

Star:
About 60 earth days as a matter of fact

Venus:
I am Venus, my atmosphere’s super hot
I spin backwards in a way the earth does not
I’m closest to the earth in distance and size
I have no moons, I hope you can sympathize

Earth:
I’m earth, the planet that you’re on, ya know
I’m terrestrial, but covered in H20
I collide with things that I can’t avoid
But my atmosphere protects me from meteoroids

Mars:
I’m Mars and you can jump higher on me,
Because I have a third of earth’s gravity
I hear you plan to visit soon
I’ll be your first destination since the moon

Jupiter:
I’m Jupiter, with my 79 moon crew
Like Io and S/2003…

Moons:
J 2!

Jupiter:
Yea, you could say I have a pretty large girth
Here’s a storm twice the size of yo momma, 
Earth

Moons: 
Ohhh!

Saturn:
My name’s Saturn, check out my pretty rings
These rings are a few of my favorite things
I’m a giant made of hydrogen and helium
And please, stop hitting me with things

Uranus:
My name’s Uranus, and I’m an ice giant

Neptune: 
That’s dope!

Uranus:
I was the first planet found with a telescope
I rotate backwards, and on my side
I smell like rotten eggs, 
But that’s just the hydrogen sulfide

Neptune:
I’m Neptune, I’m the windiest planet around
I’ve got supersonic winds
That’s faster than sound
An ice giant with 13 moons
And a dark vortex that may go away soon

Pluto:
I’m Pluto, and I will not be forgotten!

Stage Manager:
Pluto, Pluto, Pluto, Pluto… beautiful, but, um… yea, we’ve been over this, and… you’re considered a dwarf planet these days, sooo…

Pluto:
Gurl, I’m the biggest object in the Kuiper Belt.

Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars
Jupiter, Saturn
Uranus, Neptune

Jupiter: 
Sing along, real strong, for the next tune

Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars
Jupiter, Saturn
Uranus, Neptune

Pluto:
And, I guess, not Pluto

There are 5 categories of globulins: alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2 and gamma.
The patient's serum is placed on a special medium (e.g., cellulose, agar) and then an electric charge  is applied for a period of time when the proteins will migrate from the negative pole to the positive one. Albumin migrates and reaches the positive pole and gamma globulins will remain at the negative pole, resulting in the fractions specific to each protein.
With the help of the staining step, the fractions are highlighted and can be interpreted by means of readers that measure optical density. The results are expressed for each type of protein in part and expressed as: normal, low, increased.

YC-75aUSf2M,Addgene,UCFS_3MJQzUr2H4_5km59xOQ,1560962909.0,Purifying DNA from an Agarose Gel,"Gel purification allows you to isolate and purify DNA fragments based on size. Following gel electrophoresis, you can cut DNA bands out of the agarose gel and purify the DNA samples. This is a commonly used technique for molecular cloning, such as PCR- or restriction enzyme-based cloning.

https://www.addgene.org/protocols/gel-purification/

In this video we will show you how to excise a DNA band from an agarose gel. This protocol begins after our DNA has been prepared and separated using agarose gel electrophoresis. To learn more about how we did this, please see our Agarose Gel Electrophoresis protocol video, or check out our written protocol:

This video focuses on discussing various types of antigen antibody reactions and their clinical importance.
The word affinity is used to describe the strength of binding between one antibody binding site and an antigenic determinant (epitope or hapten).   The association constant is the mathematical value that is the measure of the strength of binding.

 

Anibody molecules are multivalent and antigens are also often multivalent.  This multivalency tends to increase the strength of the interaction, and this really represents the true state of affairs.  This overall binding energy that results in the binding of a multivalent antibody with a multivalent antigen is called the functional affinity  or the avidity.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oynjZ9IVSzU/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-13 18:54:27.638263

The IlluminOss System incorporates a PET or Dacron® balloon catheter that is delivered through a small pathway into the intramedullary canal transiting the fracture site.

Using a standard syringe, IlluminOss’ light activated, biocompatible monomer is infused into the balloon, causing it to expand, fill, and conform to the patients intramedullary canal. 

Upon the activation of IlluminOss’ visible light source, the monomer infused balloon begin to cure. The cured implant provides both longitudinal strength and rotational stability to the compromised bone. Should ancillary fixation devices be needed they can be placed anywhere along the implant.

▼▼ More infos and links are just a click away ▼▼

Cancer is a creepy and mysterious thing. While we tried to understand it, to get better at killing it, we discovered a biological paradox that remains unsolved to this day: large animals seem to be immune to cancer. Which doesn’t make any sense – the bigger a being, the more cancer it should have. To understand why, we first need to take a look at the nature of cancer itself.

Getting rare materials from the ground into your phone is ugly. The mining industry is responsible for air and water pollution and the destruction of entire landscapes. But what if we could replace the mining industry on Earth with a clean process that can’t harm anyone? Well, we can. All we need to do is look up.

Knowing your viral load can help your doctor with monitoring your disease and providing you with treatment schedules. This animation describes how viral load is measured by your doctor and clinic, and what a high versus low viral load can mean over time with respect to virus reproduction and treatment.

This animation describes how adhering to your prescribed medication schedule is beneficial and minimizes the risk that your HIV will develop resistance to your medical treatment. It is important for people living with HIV to listen to their doctor and to take their HIV medicines on a regular basis, as prescribed.

1i3C2fNc5s8,TEDx Talks,UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q,1579625274.0,Can we cure HIV with an injection? | Dr. Hans-Peter Kiem | TEDxSeattle,"HIV was thought to be incurable, but after undergoing risky stem cell transplant surgeries, several patients no longer exhibit the deadly virus. Scientist Dr. Hans-Peter Kiem takes that idea a step further and shares his pioneering research using new gene-editing techniques. His bold vision may one day allow patients anywhere in the world to receive a single injection to stop HIV and other deadly diseases in their tracks. 

Special thanks to core the TEDxSeattle organizing team, 100+ volunteers, and our generous partners – without you, this experience would not be possible. Find out more about our talks, speakers, entertainers, activities, and year-round events at TEDxSeattle.com.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark in-depth discussion and connection in a community setting. These events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.

Hans-Peter, the Director of the Stem Cell and Gene Therapy program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, is known as a pioneer in the development of new gene-editing technologies. Through his work as an oncologist providing bone marrow transplants to leukemia patients, Dr. Kiem learned it’s possible to modify genes in blood marrow stem cells and convey those genetic changes to a patient.

Hans-Peter and his team hope to achieve cures for diseases like HIV, cancer, sickle cell anemia, and other blood disorders with this ability to repair or modify genes by editing stem cells to carry healthier or disease-resistant versions of genes before transplant. He is currently pioneering “in vivo” and “ex vivo” approaches to make gene therapy and gene editing more broadly available and accessible to those living with HIV, especially in resource-limited settings. 

He received his M.D. and Ph.D., at the University of Ulm in Germany. Hans-Peter came to the United States in 1988 and completed research at Stanford University. He received a degree in internal medicine at Vanderbilt University before an oncology fellowship at the University of Washington led to his work with the Fred Hutch.

A METTLER TOLEDO UV/VIS spectrophotometer is based on a flashing xenon lamp, which produces intensive light with wavelengths ranging from 190 up to 1100. The combination of array technology and a xenon light source enables full spectrum scans within seconds. The light is guided by glass fibers through the sample which leads to absorption of specific wavelengths. The beam of light is then guided to the CCD detector pixels, enabling simultaneous measurement of the complete spectrum from UV to visible. The individual intensities of light are then computed into a spectrum.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XAp-5r3LxQo/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-13 18:54:38.843961

A diagnosis of myocardial infarction is created by integrating the history of the presenting illness and physical examination with electrocardiogram findings and cardiac markers (blood tests for heart muscle cell damage).A coronary angiogram allows visualization of narrowings or obstructions on the heart vessels, and therapeutic measures can follow immediately. At autopsy, a pathologist can diagnose a myocardial infarction based on anatomopathological findings.

They have diagnostic importance and are called cardiac markers. 

The cardiac markers of major diagnostic interest includes, enzymes such as:
– Creatine kinase (CK)
– Lactate dehydrogenase (LD)
– Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or serum glutamate transaminase (SGOT).
Non-enzyme proteins such as:
– Cardiac troponin T and I (cTnT and cTnI)

Normal level
Fasting plasma glucose- 70 to 110 mg/dl
Post meal plasma glucose-110 to 140 mg/dl
Random plasma glucose- 70 to 140 mg/dl

SOURCES OF BLOOD GLUCOSE AND UTILIZATION
Effect of hormones
1. Insulin- lowers blood glucose, increases uptake, promote Glycogenesis and glycolysis, inhibit gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis
2. Glucagon- increases blood glucose, promote glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis
3. Epinephrine- increases blood glucose, promote glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis
4. Growth hormone, cortisol, ACTH, thyroid hormones- increases blood glucose

 ROLE OF GLUCAGON AND EPINEPHRINE IN GLUCOSE REGULATION
 ROLE OF INSULIN IN GLUCOSE REGULATION
 GLUCOSE UTILIZATION IN DIFFERENT STATES
1. In well fed state – dietary glucose is used for glycogen and fat synthesis. All cells utilize glucose as a source of energy.
2. Post absorptive state- in this state source of glucose is by hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to some extent. Source of energy for brain is glucose. Liver and skeletal muscle utilizes fatty acids as a source of energy.
3. Starvation- After 16 to 18 hrs of fast glycogen store get completely Depleted. Gluconeogenesis in liver and kidney is main source of glucose. Brain utilizes glucose and ketone bodies as a fuel.
4. Prolonged starvation- after several days, main source for gluconeogenesis is muscle proteins. Brain completely depends on ketone bodies as a fuel.

Renal threshold- level of plasma glucose beyond which it is excreted in urine (180mg/dl )
Methods of estimation of plasma glucose
1. Glucose oxidase-peroxidase method
2. Hexokinase method
3. By glucometer 

Increase/ Decrease in plasma glucose is called as HYPERGLYCEMIA/HYPOGLYCEMIA",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n91BckD0mMU/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-13 18:54:39.388169

Biography: Dr. Dina Schneider holds PhD in Pharmacology and Toxicology from Michigan State University. Her doctoral thesis focused on pathways of B cell activation and differentiation. Her post-doctoral work at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, focused on cellular immune responses to viral infections in airway inflammatory diseases. In 2011, Dr. Schneider transitioned to industry, where she contributed to numerous projects in synthetic immunology, immunotherapy, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-based therapy. Dr. Schneider leads the Cell Biology group at Lentigen Technology, Inc., a Miltenyi Biotec Company, in Gaithersburg, MD. Her group is focused on pre-clinical development of novel CAR-based therapies, and on the implementation of CliniMACS Prodigy® platform for preparation of cell-based therapeutics.

WEBINAR: Chimeric Antigen Receptors: From proof of concept to widely applicable clinical research solutions

Webinar Abstract: Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-transduced T lymphocytes have demonstrated impressive clinical activity against B cell malignancies in phase I trials.  In most instances, lentivirus-based or a retrovirus-based gene vectors were used to introduce the therapeutic gene expression cassette into the genome of T lymphocytes.  The gene expression cassette is composed of an internal promoter and the CAR, created by splicing together of extracellular antigen-binding motifs, linker and transmembrane domains, and intracellular lymphocyte signaling domains.  This synthetic engineered receptor can be modified in a number of ways in order to further improve CAR T efficacy and safety.  We have found that the combination of two extracellular binding domains is possible, thus expanding the antigens targeted by a single CAR construct, and potentially providing a more effective barrier to the generation of antigen-escape variants. Making CAR-based immunotherapy broadly available to those in need, requires the ability to isolate, activate, transduce, and expand T cell or NK cell populations in a safe clinically-relevant platform.  The CliniMACS® Prodigy is a closed cell culture system that combines recent advances in lymphocyte isolation (using antibody-conjugated matrices), activation (using an anti-CD3/CD28 nanomatrix), and automated culture using optimized media and cytokines, into a single platform suitable for the introduction of therapeutic gene vectors, lymphocyte transduction, culture and expansion, and final formulation.  Using clinical-grade lentivirus-based gene vectors we have demonstrated the ability to produce CAR-expressing T cells.  The CliniMACS® Prodigy platform provides a standardized solution for broad application of CAR-based therapies in clinical studies.

Primary outcome

All-cause in-hospital mortality

Secondary outcomes, mortality in patients with severe pulmonary involvement, extubation rates for mechanically ventilated patients, length of stay

Severe pulmonary involvement

Need for Fio2 ≥ 50%, noninvasive ventilation

Invasive ventilation

Results from reviews

N = 280

Ivermectin treated = 173

Overall mortality 15%

Mortality with severe pulmonary involvement = 38.8%

Not given ivermectin = 107

Overall mortality 25% (OR, 0.52)

Mortality with severe pulmonary involvement = 80.7%

No significant differences were found in extubation rates or length of stay

Most patients in both groups also received hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both

Interpretation

Ivermectin treatment was associated with lower mortality during treatment of COVID-19 

Especially in patients with severe pulmonary involvement

Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings

Vitamin D Levels Appear to Play Role in COVID-19 Mortality Rates

China, France, Germany, Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, United States.

Patients with severe deficiency are twice as likely to experience major complications

Spanish clinical trial

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7456194/

Calcifediol group, 2% required admission to the ICU

Control group 50% admitted to ICU

Put another way, the use of Vitamin D reduced a patient’s risk of needing intensive care 25-fold

The Government should now act on this latest evidence

We have good reason to think vitamin D supplementation will help reduce mortality from Covid-19

we know it can reduce the incidence and severity of the other acute respiratory illnesses

pressures from influenza during the winter months

This will no doubt save thousands of lives in any second wave

There is now no reason not to act

Covid-19: Do many people have pre-existing immunity? (21 September 2020, Eshani M King, BMJ)

Critical in viral immunity

T cell response might be more important that B cell response

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pai.13263

B‐cell response might be important, but is not strictly required to overcome the disease

Vaccines focused on antibody levels

Mild or asymptomatic cases, many T-cells are produced

In these mild cases, few or no detectable antibodies

Men produced fewer T-cells than women

Older men produce less T cells than younger men

Vitamin D controls T cell antigen receptor signaling and activation of human T cells, (University of Copenhagen)

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20208539/

Vitamin D essential to facilitate maturation of naïve T cells to dedicated, specific T cells

When a T cell is exposed to a foreign pathogen, it extends a vitamin D receptor, with which it searches for vitamin D

Dr. Seheult is back to illustrate why T cells have received less attention than antibodies, but may be more important to long term immunity from COVID-19.  Dr. Seheult also discusses how previous infections with common coronaviruses may provide some immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and the hypothesis that reducing the inoculum (initial dose) of SARS-CoV-2 might result in less symptom severity (This video was recorded August 10, 2020).

sJptG3_uiVg,Hussain Biology,UCDCg5AAslixldHh5D7Nu6-g,1598965286.0,Antigen,"An antigen (Ag) is a molecule or molecular structure, such as may be present at the outside of a pathogen, that can be bound to by an antigen-specific antibody (Ab) or B cell antigen receptor (BCR). The presence of antigens in the body normally triggers an immune response. The term ""antigen"" originally described a structural molecule that binds specifically to an antibody only in the form of native antigen,It was expanded later to refer to any molecule or a linear molecular fragment after processing the native antigen that can be recognized by T-cell receptor (TCR). BCR and TCR are both highly variable antigen receptors diversified by somatic V(D)J recombination. Both T cells and B cells are cellular components of adaptive immunity.  The Ag abbreviation stands for an antibody generator.

Antigens are ""targeted"" by antibodies. Each antibody is specifically produced by the immune system to match an antigen after cells in the immune system come into contact with it; this allows a precise identification or matching of the antigen and the initiation of a tailored response. The antibody is said to ""match"" the antigen in the sense that it can bind to it due to an adaptation in a region of the antibody; because of this, many different antibodies are produced, each able to bind a different antigen while sharing the same basic structure. In most cases, an adapted antibody can only react to and bind one specific antigen; in some instances, however, antibodies may cross-react and bind more than one antigen.

Also, an antigen is a molecule that binds to Ag-specific receptors, but cannot necessarily induce an immune response in the body by itself.[3] Antigens are usually proteins, peptides (amino acid chains) and polysaccharides (chains of monosaccharides/simple sugars) but lipids and nucleic acids become antigens only when combined with proteins and polysaccharides.[4] In general, saccharides and lipids (as opposed to peptides) qualify as antigens but not as immunogens since they cannot elicit an immune response on their own. Furthermore, for a peptide to induce an immune response (activation of T-cells by antigen-presenting cells) it must be a large enough size, since peptides too small will also not elicit an immune response.

The antigen may originate from within the body (""self-antigen"") or from the external environment (""non-self""). The immune system is supposed to identify and attack ""non-self"" invaders from the outside world or modified/harmful substances present in the body and usually does not react to self-antigens under normal homeostatic conditions due to negative selection of T cells in the thymus.

Vaccines are examples of antigens in an immunogenic form, which are intentionally administered to a recipient to induce the memory function of adaptive immune system toward the antigens of the pathogen invading that recipient.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sJptG3_uiVg/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-13 18:54:47.070983

Low-dose Hydroxychloroquine Therapy and Mortality in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: A Nationwide Observational Study of 8075 Participants (International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, 24 August)

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920303423

Background

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been largely used and investigated as therapy of COVID-19 , at total dose usually ranging from 2400 mg to 9600 mg.

In Belgium, off-label use of low-dose HCQ (2400 mg in total over five days) was recommended for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

“low-dose” regimen of HCQ sulphate in monotherapy 

400mg twice on day 1

200mg twice a day from day 2 to 5

i.e. a total dose of 2400 mg

Methods

Multi-centric design 

Vast majority of Belgian hospitals

Retrospective analysis

In-hospital mortality in Belgium

40 day follow up

No difference in the baseline characteristics

Groups

HCQ alone and supportive care

Supportive care only

Adjusted for demographic and clinical features

Results

8075 patients with complete discharge data

HCQ group, n = 4,542

Deaths, 804, (17.7%)

no-HCQ group, n = 3,533

Deaths, 957 (27.1%)

Multivariable analysis

Mortality was lower in the HCQ group compared to the no-HCQ group 

Hazard ratio = 0.684

Estimated direct-adjusted mortality at 40 days 

19.1% with HCQ alone

26.5% with supportive care only

Mortality in the HCQ group was reduced

Both in patients diagnosed in less than 5 days and more than 5 days

Conclusions

Compared to supportive care only, low-dose HCQ monotherapy was independently associated with lower mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 diagnosed and treated early or later after symptom onset.

Wir beziehen uns hierbei auf die Empfehlungen des RKI und der WHO. Aufgrund der aktuellen Situation verzichten wir im Folgenden auf die Verwendung von Schutzkleidung zum Einsparen von Ressourcen.

Zum offenen COVID-19 Kapitel: https://go.amboss.com/c19-abstrich

Beim Nasenrachenabstrich wird der Virustupfer gerade in eine Nasenloch eingeführt, nah an Septum und Nasenboden parallel zum Gaumen vorsichtig soweit vorgeschoben, bis die hintere Rachenwand als leichter Widerstand spürbar ist (beim Erwachsenen nach ca. 5-6 cm). Dort wird der Tupfer für einige Sekunden belassen und leicht gedreht, bevor er langsam wieder herausgezogen wird.

Durchführung eines Rachenabstrichs (Oropharynx-Abstrich): Während der Patient “Ahhh” sagt und man seine Zunge mit dem Mundspatel nach unten drückt, wird der zweite Virustupfer vorsichtig in den Mundraum geführt. Ein Kontakt mit Zähnen, weichem Gaumen und Zunge muss vermieden werden. An der hinteren Pharynxwand wird der Tupfer vorsichtig entlang gewischt. Dabei gilt es zu beachten, dass dadurch ein Würgereflex ausgelöst werden kann! Bei der Rückführung des Tupfers muss ebenso sorgfältig der Kontakt mit Zähnen, weichem Gaumen und Zunge vermieden werden.

Bmhos0E33jE,Sam Webster,UCMRHZcgwdSE_9wbwcP8aRJw,1585054191.0,Pelvic arteries (internal iliac artery),"Like much of the anatomy in the pelvis, the blood supply is messy, complex and variable. Let's attempt to look at the arteries of the pelvis by following the internal iliac artery and its branches. If I try to reconstruct them with pipecleaners it might help or make it worse. Let's find out.

The internal iliac artery branches from the common iliac artery, moves into the pelvis and splits into anterior and posterior divisions. The anterior division is responsible for supplying blood to the viscera and gives off the superior vesical arteries, obturator artery, vaginal or inferior vesical artery, uterine artery in the female pelvis, middle rectal artery, inferior gluteal artery and internal pudendal artery. The internal pudendal artery has yet more branches, including the inferior rectal artery.

The posterior division sends branches posteriorly to the muscles of the posterior abdominal wall and back.

The complement system is a part of the immune system that enhances (complements) the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear microbes and damaged cells from an organism, promotes inflammation, and attacks the pathogen's plasma membrane. It is part of the innate immune system,[1] which is not adaptable and does not change over the course of an individual's lifetime. It can be recruited and brought into action by the adaptive immune system.

The complement system consists of a number of small proteins found in the blood, in general synthesized by the liver, and normally circulating as inactive precursors (pro-proteins). When stimulated by one of several triggers, proteases in the system cleave specific proteins to release cytokines and initiate an amplifying cascade of further cleavages. The end result of this complement activation or complement fixation cascade is stimulation of phagocytes to clear foreign and damaged material, proxy inflammation to attract additional phagocytes, and activation of the cell-killing membrane attack complex. Over 30 proteins and protein fragments make up the complement system, including serum proteins, serosal proteins, and cell membrane receptors. They account for about 10% of the globulin fraction of blood serum and can serve as opsonins.[citation needed]

Three biochemical pathways activate the complement system: the classical complement pathway, the alternative complement pathway, and the lectin pathway.

Most of the proteins and glycoproteins that constitute the complement system are synthesized by hepatocytes. But significant amounts are also produced by tissue macrophages, blood monocytes, and epithelial cells of the genitourinal tract and gastrointestinal tract. The three pathways of activation all generate homologous variants of the protease C3-convertase. The classical complement pathway typically requires antigen—antibody complexes (immune complexes) for activation (specific immune response), whereas the alternative pathway can be activated by C3 hydrolysis, foreign material, pathogens, or damaged cells. The mannose-binding lectin pathway can be activated by C3 hydrolysis or antigens without the presence of antibodies (non-specific immune response). In all three pathways, C3-convertase cleaves and activates component C3, creating C3a and C3b, and causes a cascade of further cleavage and activation events. C3b binds to the surface of pathogens, leading to greater internalization by phagocytic cells by opsonization.

In the alternative pathway, C3b binds to Factor B. Factor D releases Factor Ba from Factor B bound to C3b. The complex of C3b(2)Bb is a protease which cleaves C5 into C5b and C5a. C5 convertase is also formed by the Classical Pathway when C3b binds C4b and C2a. C5a is an important chemotactic protein, helping recruit inflammatory cells. C3a is the precursor of an important cytokine (adipokine) named ASP (although this is not universally accepted [6]) and is usually rapidly cleaved by carboxypeptidase B. Both C3a and C5a have anaphylatoxin activity, directly triggering degranulation of mast cells as well as increasing vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction.[6] C5b initiates the membrane attack pathway, which results in the membrane attack complex (MAC), consisting of C5b, C6, C7, C8, and polymeric C9.[7] MAC is the cytolytic endproduct of the complement cascade; it forms a transmembrane channel, which causes osmotic lysis of the target cell. Kupffer cells and other macrophage cell types help clear complement-coated pathogens. As part of the innate immune system, elements of the complement cascade can be found in species earlier than vertebrates; most recently in the protostome horseshoe crab species, putting the origins of the system back further than was previously thought.

This video has an immune system animation. The innate immune system consists of defenses against infection that are activated instantly as a pathogen attacks. Adaptive immunity (or acquired immunity) is a subsystem of the immune system that contains highly specialised systemic cells and processes that kill pathogens and prevent their growth in the body. Innate vs adaptive immunity: it’s important to realize that innate and adaptive immunity are different. Their differences are explained in the video in layman terms.

Our immune system is a fascinating entity, that functions in quite a unique and efficient manner. Comprising of various types of cells, it is prepared for any kind of breach in the fortress of our body, and is equipped to fight off a staggering number of intruders.
In this video, we give you a brief overview of the immune system, and the basic types of cells involved, along with the function they carry out.

Each cell if the immune system carries out various roles, depending on the kind of threat the body is facing. However, they have certain basic roles which have been explained here.

Quizlet Review: https://quizlet.com/_6jggx7

The immune system has two main branches: the innate immune response and the adaptive immune response.
The innate immune response includes cells and mechanisms that are able to react to pathogens from birth.  The adaptive immune system can learn and remember new pathogens and then protect from them long-term.
The innate immune system is composed of:
1. physical barriers such as mucous membranes and skin
2. chemical barriers such as lysozyme and stomach acid.
3. Complement is a group of small circulating chemicals that, when triggered, form a ""membrane attack complex"" that can punch holes in pathogen cell membranes.
The leukocytes that are involved in this response include:
*Granulocytes - neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils
*Agranulocytes - macrophages and dendritic cells, which can be phagocytic and present antigens from invaders to the adaptive immune response cells known as helper T cells. 
*Lymphocytes - Natural killer cells (NK cells) can cause apoptosis of tumor cells and viral-infected cells.

The adaptive immune response includes T and B lymphocytes.  These cells must be activated to a specific pathogen before they can respond.  

Helper T cells stimulate cytotoxic T cells to directly destroy pathogens.  Helper T cells stimulate B lymphocytes to enlarge into plasma cells and produce antibodies.

These lymphocytes all reproduce rapidly and form memory cells that remain circulating and passing through lymph organs long-term to patrol for the presence of the specific pathogen in the future.

All leukocytes are formed in the bone marrow in a process known as hematopoiesis.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QdYuibhnUuE/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:01.312571

Immunoglobulins/Antibody   Structure Types and Function
LIKE US ON FACEBOOK : fb.me/Medsimplified
Antibody (Ab), also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a large, Y-shape protein produced by plasma cells that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the harmful agent, called an antigen, via the variable region
Each tip of the ""Y"" of an antibody contains a paratope (analogous to a lock) that is specific for one particular epitope (similarly analogous to a key) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with precision. Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly (for example, by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival).

Antibodies are glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily; ] the terms antibody and immunoglobulin are often used interchangeably.  Though strictly speaking, an antibody is not the same as an immunoglobulin; B cells can produce two types of immunoglobulins - surface immunoglobulins, which are B cell receptors; and secreted immunoglobulins, which are antibodies. So antibodies are one of two classes of immunoglobulins. 

Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen-binding sites, to exist. This region is known as the hypervariable region. Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. This enormous diversity of antibody paratopes on the antigen-binding fragments allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens The large and diverse population of antibody paratope is generated by random recombination events of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen-binding sites (or paratopes), followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity.[  This recombinational process that produces clonal antibody paratope diversity is called V(D)J or VJ recombination. Basically, the antibody paratope is polygenic, made up of three genes, V, D, and J. Each paratope locus is also polymorphic, such that during antibody production, one allele of V, one of D, and one of J is chosen. These gene segments are then joined together using random genetic recombination to produce the paratope. The regions where the genes are randomly recombined together is the hyper variable region used to recognise different antigens on a clonal basis.
IgA   Found in mucosal areas, such as the gut, respiratory tract and urogenital tract, and prevents colonization by pathogens.[14] Also found in saliva, tears, and breast milk. Some antibodies form complexes that bind to multiple antigen molecules.

IgD  Functions mainly as an antigen receptor on B cells that have not been exposed to antigens. ] It has been shown to activate basophils and mast cells to produce antimicrobial factors.
 
IgE   Binds to allergens and triggers histamine release from mast cells and basophils, and is involved in allergy. Also protects against parasitic worms 

IgG  In its four forms, provides the majority of antibody-based immunity against invading pathogens.  The only antibody capable of crossing the placenta to give passive immunity to the fetus.

IgM   Expressed on the surface of B cells (monomer) and in a secreted form (pentamer) with very high avidity. Eliminates pathogens in the early stages of B cell-mediated (humoral) immunity before there is sufficient IgG

--

The immune system is a vast network of cells, tissues, and organs that coordinate your body’s defenses against any threats to your health. Without it, you’d be exposed to billions of bacteria, viruses, and toxins that could make something as minor as a paper cut or a seasonal cold fatal. So how does it work? Emma Bryce takes you inside the body to find out.

This was an antibody harvested from the convalescent plasma of a patient who had recovered from COVID-19. It had a very high affinity to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and prevented infection in non-human primates. We will discuss what this antibody is and how it works. We will then dive into a study that used this antibody to treat patients with early outpatient COVID-19. Check out the video for all the details!

No mRNA vaccine has ever been approved by the FDA, but Pfizer and BioNTech hope to receive emergency approval based on preliminary data from their ongoing vaccine trial.  

This two-dose vaccine regimen has limitations including the need for -70 C refrigeration and many questions remain: 
Will the vaccine prevent transmission and asymptomatic spread?  
How long will immunity last?  
Will “90% effective” hold up to peer-review and additional data when it is gathered?

Vitamin D Status in Hospitalized Patients With SARS-CoV-2 Infection 

The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (Accepted, 27th October 2020)

https://academic.oup.com/jcem/advance-article/doi/10.1210/clinem/dgaa733/5934827

To assess serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels in hospitalized patients with COVID-19

Analyze the possible influence of vitamin D status on disease severity

Retrospective

Case-control

216 COVID-19 patients

197 population-based controls

Results

Vitamin D deficiency was defined as serum 25OHD levels  less than 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/L) 

COVID patients group

Mean levels 13.8  ng/ml. (34.5 nmol/L)

82.2% vitamin D deficient 

Community control group

Mean levels 20.9 ng/ml (52.25 nmol/L) (p less than 0.0001)

47.2% vitamin D deficient

Blood levels lower in men than in women


Evidence of protective role of Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation in reducing COVID-19 deaths (Nature scientific reports, 19th October 2020)

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74825-z

Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation, mediated by vitamin D synthesis

Dataset of 152 countries over 108 days (n = 6,524)

A permanent unit increase in UVI is associated with a 1.2 percentage points decline in daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths

and a 1.0 percentage points decline in the CFR daily growth rate

Globally
Minus 12% of cumulative COVID-19 deaths

Minus 38% on CFR

We find a significant negative association between UVI and COVID-19 deaths

indicating evidence of the protective role of UVB in mitigating COVID-19 deaths

If confirmed via clinical studies, then the possibility of mitigating COVID-19 deaths via sensible sunlight exposure or vitamin D intervention would be very attractive


Vitamin D sufficiency, a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at least 30 ng/mL reduced risk for adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239799

Association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and its effect on adverse clinical outcomes

n = 235

Results

Based on CDC criteria, among our study patients, 74% had severe COVID-19 infection and 32.8% were vitamin D sufficient. 

Vitamin D sufficiency

25(OH)D less than 30 ng/ml.  (75 nmol/L)

Reduction in clinical severity

Inpatient mortality

Serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP)

Increase in lymphocyte percentage

Vitamin D insufficiency in southern Arizona (American Journal of Clinical Nutrition)

https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/87/3/608/4633323

Population 26.1 ng/ml  (65.25 nmol/L)

Below 20 ng/ml  (50 nmol/L)

Blacks 55%

Hispanics 37.6%

Whites 22.7% 

Also more obesity in first two groups

Northern Arapaho and Eastern Shoshone tribes sharing the Wind River Indian Reservation (WRIR) in Wyoming reportedly die 30 years earlier than whites in the state

Nearly 80% of adults had deficient vitamin D levels ( less than 20 ng/mL; n = 167) (50 nmol/L)

Obesity 

Waist circumference, associated with higher risk of obesity-related disease

Women 95%

No mRNA vaccine has ever been approved by the FDA, but Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech hope to receive emergency approval based on preliminary data from their ongoing vaccine trials.  

Moderna's two-dose vaccine regimen does not require special refrigeration (the Pfizer vaccine is supposed to be stored at -70 Celcius) but a variety of questions remain:
Will the vaccine prevent transmission and asymptomatic spread?  
How long will immunity last?  
Will “94.5% effective” hold up to peer-review and additional data when it is gathered?

K3ksKkCOgTw,CBC News,UCuFFtHWoLl5fauMMD5Ww2jA,1412345454.0,The Secrets of Sugar - the fifth estate,"We’ve heard for years about the dangers of eating too much fat or salt. But there have never been recommended limits for sugar on Canadian food labels, despite emerging research that suggests the sweet stuff may be making more of us fat and sick. In the fifth estate’s season premiere, Gillian Findlay digs into the surprising science — and the reaction from the food industry — to reveal The Secrets of Sugar. Has the sugar industry been hiding an unsavoury truth from consumers?

A small but influential group of medical researchers is stirring up the health debate, linking sugar not just to rising obesity rates but also to a host of diseases including cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer’s.

We put a family of four on a healthy diet to try to beat their sugar habit and track the surprising results. We talk to leading scientists – and their critics. And we ask the food industry why those ingredient labels are far from clear when it comes to how much sugar is really on your plate.

 Former British Diplomat to China, Matthew Henderson, co-authored a report for a legal class action against the Chinese Communist Party, for the massive economic damage caused by COVID-19. In an extended interview with reporter Tara Brown, he says the most appalling part of the cover up was quashing early concerns  about a new frightening virus raised by Chinese doctors and scientists in Wuhan.

https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMp2026913?articleTools=true

Universal mask wearing might make mild or asymptomatic disease more likely

A form of “variolation” 

Inoculation

Generate immunity and thereby slow the spread of the virus

Viral shedding from the noses and mouths of patients, presymptomatic or asymptomatic

Shedding rates equivalent to those among symptomatic patients

SARS -1

A strong relationship between public masking and pandemic control 

SARS - CoV - 2

Recent virologic, epidemiologic, and ecologic data

Hypothesis that facial masking may also reduce the severity of disease among people who 
do become infected 

Long-standing theory of viral pathogenesis

Severity of disease is proportionate to the viral inoculum received 

Typical rate of asymptomatic infection, estimated to be 40% by the CDC in mid-July,

Settings with universal facial masking, 80%

Also less severe and less deaths

We recorded this video in response to your comments asking what Dr. Seheult's daily regimen is - to optimize his immune system and minimize COVID-19 risk.  In the absence of good clinical data that is specific to SARS-CoV-2, Dr. Seheult discusses supplements, sleep, and his daily disinfection routine when removing PPE, getting in his car, and returning home from the hospital.  We look forward to more randomized, blinded, placebo-control studies in the future that will build upon the current body of evidence as it relates to immunity and specifically coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2.

Population 127 million

Cases, 89,650

Deaths, 1,631

Fatality rates, low compared to Western Countries

Decreased despite the absence of lockdown 

? low infection prevalence

? low IFR

Seroprevalence among asymptomatic employees, Tokyo

May 26 to August 25

Healthy volunteer workers, n = 1,877 

IgM and IgG antibodies, test repeated at a month

Symptomatics excluded

Seroconversion

Seroreversion

Results

615 healthy volunteers received at least one test
 
Seroprevalence increased from 5.8 % to 46.8 % over summer

Paralleling the rise in daily confirmed cases within Tokyo

Exclusion of individuals with clinical symptoms, probable underestimation

Peaked on August 4

Peaked with the peak of the second wave

Out of the 350 individuals who completed both offered tests

21.4 % who tested seronegative became seropositive

Seroreversion was found in 12.2 % of initially seropositive participants

81.1% of IgM positive cases at first testing became IgM negative in approximately one month 

IgM+/IgG- was the least common, 0.4% (3/700 total tests)

Short time frame between developing IgM then developing IgG

None of the seroconverted individuals were hospitalized or died

Conclusions

COVID-19 infection may have spread widely across the general population of Tokyo

http://www.academie-medecine.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20.5.22-Vitamine-D-et-coronavirus-ENG.pdf

Vitamin D is a prohormone

Synthesized in the dermis under the effect of ultraviolet light

Transported to the liver and kidneys, where it is transformed into an active hormone

Responsible for intestinal absorption of calcium and bone health. 

Modulates the functioning of the immune system by stimulating macrophages and dendritic cells

Role in regulating and suppressing the cytokine inflammatory response

Acute respiratory distress syndrome

A significant correlation between low serum vitamin D levels and mortality from Covid- 19

This phenomenon follows a North-South gradient

Exceptions are Nordic countries, vitamin D supplementation

Not a preventive or a therapeutic

By mitigating the inflammatory storm and its consequences, considered as an adjunct to any form of therapy. 

Simple and inexpensive measure

Confirms its recommendation to ensure vitamin D supplementation in the French population

Recommends the rapid serum vitamin D (i.e. 25 OHD) testing in people over 60 years of age with Covid-19

Loading dose of 50,000 to 100,000 IU in case of deficiency, which could help limit respiratory complications; 

Recommends vitamin D supplementation of 800 to 1000 IU/day in people under 60, as soon as the diagnosis of Covid-19 is confirmed.

Observational data from various countries suggest inverse links;

Severity of COVID-19 responses
Mortality

No randomized controlled trial

Having adequate vitamin D is important, especially for those at the highest risk of COVID-19

No role
Simply a marker
A causal factor

Spain and northern Italy, high rates of vitamin D deficiency

Spain and Italy not formally fortify foods or recommend supplementation

Norway, Finland, and Sweden had higher vitamin D levels

European countries, P = .046, 95.4% confidence, (4.6% chance this result arose by chance)

Correlation is not causality

Sputnik and alcohol

Anna Popova, head of the consumer health watchdog

Komsomolskaya Pravda radio station

Stop drinking at least two weeks before first injections

Three weeks between shots

Continue to abstain for a further 42 days

Alcohol would reduce the body’s ability to build up immunity

It’s a strain on the body. If we want to be healthy and have a strong immune response, don’t drink alcohol

Alexander Gintsburg, vaccine developer

One glass of champagne won’t hurt anyone, not even your immune system

Prudent to reduce alcohol use by a reasonable amount while the body built up immunity, 
no need to give up completely.

Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for greater than six months after infection 

(16th November, Institute for Immunology CA, and University of California) 

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.15.383323v1

Humans make:

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies

CD4+ T cells (helpers)

CD8+ T cells (killers)

Memory B cells

Neutralizing antibodies have generally not correlated with lessened COVID-19 disease severity

Passive prophylactic antibodies limits disease in animals

Less so after infection

Clinical hepatitis is prevented by vaccine-elicited immune memory even in the absence of circulating antibodies

Six months or more is usually required to ascertain the durability of immune memory

Cross-sectional study

N = 185 

41 cases, more than 6 months 

Recovered COVID-19 cases

43% male, 57% female

Mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 cases

Multiple sites throughout the United States

92% of subjects were never hospitalized

7% of subjects were hospitalized

97% symptomatic

Results, B cells

Spike IgG was relatively stable over 6+ months

Spike-specific memory B cells were more abundant at 6 months than at 1 month…

detected in almost all COVID-19 cases

No apparent half-life at 5+ months post-infection

Smallpox vaccine, 60+ years

Influenza infection, 90 years

Results, T cells

SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells declined with a half-life of 3-5 months

Decay of circulating SARS-CoV-2- specific CD8+ T cell is consistent with what has been reported for another acute virus
 
Smallpox also uses CD4+ T cells, t1/2 of ~10 years

T cell memory might reach a more stable plateau, or slower decay phase, later than the first 6 months post-infection. 

Each component of SARS-CoV-2 immune memory exhibited distinct kinetics

Immunity and reinfection

Memory B and T cell responses can take 3-5 days to successfully respond to an infection 

SARS-CoV T cells 17 years after the initial infection

SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are all betacoronaviruses 

https://www.cell.com/immunity/pdf/S1074-7613(20)30312-5.pdf

SARS-CoV-2 is most similar to SARS-CoV-1

Followed by MERS-CoV (2012)

It doesn't matter that we were all doing social distancing, it doesn't matter that I'm fit as a butcher's dog, feel great  – so many people do in my circumstances. 
And actually it doesn't matter that I've had the disease and I'm bursting with antibodies.
We've got to interrupt the spread of the disease…and one of the ways we can do that now is by self isolating for 14 days when contacted by Test and Trace.

December 4, 2020 

Cases and deaths continue to increase steadily

Reference scenario, expected scale-up of vaccination

Cumulative deaths by April 1, 539,000

Peak daily deaths, 3,000 in mid-to-late January

Vaccination is likely to speed the transition back to normal later in the year

but will prevent only 9,000 deaths by April 1

A further 14,000 lives can be saved with more rapid vaccine scale-up targeting high-risk individuals

Death rate could be higher, State governors implementing packages of mandates as hospital stress becomes high

Scaling up mask use to 95% can save 66,000 lives by April 1

Current situation 

Last week, cases + 165,200 per day

Week before, + 145,900 per day

Last week, deaths + 1,660 per day

Week before, deaths + 1,470

Hydroxychloroquine treatment appears to have no increased risk in the short term among patients with rheumatoid arthritis

Long term it appears to be associated with excess cardiovascular mortality

The addition of azithromycin increases the risk of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality 
even in the short term. 

We call for careful consideration of the benefit–risk trade-off when counselling those on hydroxychloroquine treatment.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SBn4e69tGlg/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:03.920044

Recently, TrialSite News reported on a study sponsored in Bangladesh by Upazila Health & Family Planning Officer’s (UHFPO) Office, and, First Affiliated Hospital Xi’an Jiaotong University. The observational study was conducted from May 2 to June 5, 2020. The principal investigators observed 181 patients who tested positive for #COVID19. The Research team recently shared the results via preprint server and ResearchGate. The study team concluded that concerning the treatment outcome, adverse effect, and safety, the Ivermectin and #Doxycycline combination was superior to the use of #Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin therapy in the case of mild to moderate degree of COVID-19 patients. Although both treatment regimens were observed to be effective for this study, the Ivermectin treatment was superior.

Mr Dean said Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly, along with his deputy Nick Coatsworth and Labor frontbencher Chris Bowen “stand condemned” for their continuous rejections of the drug.

Hydroxychloroquine has been touted by many as a potential treatment to COVID-19, however Dr Kelly declared to the Australian people it was not effective.

Mr Dean said “the jury says very clearly, if you look at all the studies … Hydroxychloroquine is consistently effective against COVID-19 when used early and in the right combination with other drugs”.

“Paul Kelly stand up tomorrow next to the prime minister and say you are sorry because people are being denied this drug which potentially could save many lives,” he said.

N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is an over the counter supplement that has been utilized by clinicians for years to treat acetaminophen (Tylenol) overdose, as a mucolytic, and for other medical problems.  There is compelling research that NAC may also reduce the severity of viral infections like influenza, and perhaps reduce the risk of blood clots (thromboembolism) as well.  Could NAC be effective in COVID-19? Dr. Seheult illustrates these ideas and discusses the peer-reviewed data involved.

Not prolonged viral shedding

33-year-old man, good health

Immunocompetent

First infection

3 days, cough, sore throat, fever, headache

Hospitalized

Serum at day 10, negative for IgG

26th March

Oropharyngeal antigen PCR diagnosis

14th April

Discharged asymptomatic

142 days

2nd infection

Spain - UK – HK

15th August

Oropharyngeal positive at HK airport

Hospitalised, remained asymptomatic

T, 36.5 

HR, 86

BP, 133/94

SaO2, 98 RA

CRP, 8.6 mg / L

Slightly raised, suggesting acute infection

Declining during hospitalisation

Hypokalaemia

Viral load progressively decreased

Serum day 5 of hospitalisation, positive

Genome analysis

Full sequencing performed after first and second episode

Different clade/lineage

Truncation of 58 amino acids in the virus genome

23 nucleotide changes

13 of which non-synonymous mutations

4 in the spike protein

First strain

Mostly close to strains from USA or England collected in March and April

Second strain

Switzerland and England collected in July and August

Evidence

Genomics, phylogenetic analysis

142 days, viral shedding (104 days in one pregnant woman)

Raised CPR indicating acute infection

Patient had recently returned from Europe with July and August strains

Implications

Unlikely herd immunity can eliminate SARS-CoV-2

Subsequent infections likely to be milder

Virus likely to go on circulating in the human population

Vaccine will not provide lifelong infection

Vaccine studies should include patients who have recovered from COVID

People who have had COVID should be vaccinated

People who have had COVID should continue with public health measures

Residual low level of antibodies may have controlled the second infection

Dr Maria Van Kerkhove

I haven't read the study

Our expectations, people who are infected with this virus develop an immune response 

People do develop an immune response, not completely clear yet is how strong and how long lasting

Severe, mild, asymptomatic cases, develop an immune response

More than 24 million cases

On a population level

Following infection, many patients have donated their plasma containing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to try to help patients with severe symptoms fight COVID-19.  The big news today is that the emergency approval from the FDA for the use of plasma treatment is now on hold based on a lack of robust data that demonstrates efficacy.

Dr. Seheult of https://www.medcram.com explains how excess deaths are a key tool in understanding the impact of an epidemic - whether it is caused by influenza, COVID 19, or another virus - and helps dispel ideas of inaccurate death certificates by going through the steps of filling a death certificate out.

An interesting hypothesis has emerged (that was initially formulated on a supercomputer) about the possible role of bradykinin in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.  The researchers surmise that bradykinin storm may have a greater impact than a cytokine storm as others have suggested (This video was recorded September 3, 2020).

What is COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 19)? The coronaviruses that circulate among humans are typically benign, and they cause about a quarter of all common cold illnesses. But occasionally, coronaviruses, like COVID-19,  circulate in an animal reservoir and mutate just enough to where they’re able to start infecting and causing disease in humans.

The ACE-2 receptor on our cells is the binding site for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. As a result, the ACE-2 receptor is central to many important questions about coronavirus treatment, a COVID-19 vaccine, and should patients continue taking their ACE inhibitor / ARBs (Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers) medications.  Dr. Seheult discusses the controversy about some of these questions and illustrates the pathway involved with the ACE-2 receptor.

Some experts have suggested that antihypertensive medications, such as ACE inhibitors increase a person’s risk of severe outcomes to SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
More and more data are now accumulating that they are perfectly safe and should not be stopped. In this update, we’ll look at several published articles that demonstrate that ACE inhibitors and ARBs were not associated with worse outcomes or increased mortality.

wvTv8TqWC48,RCSBProteinDataBank,UCBkuiMC1rIybuTcyMK-jWKw,1510858170.0,What is a Protein? (from PDB-101),"Proteins play countless roles throughout the biological world, from catalyzing chemical reactions to building the structures of all living things. Despite this wide range of functions, all proteins are made out of the same twenty one amino acids, but combined in different ways. The way these twenty amino acids are arranged dictates the folding of the protein into its unique final shape. Since protein function is based on the ability to recognize and bind to specific molecules, having the correct shape is critical for proteins to do their jobs correctly.

518XZrkyfFs,Engadget,UC-6OW5aJYBFM33zXQlBKPNA,1585105772.0,Hunting coronavirus protein with the biggest supercomputer on Earth | Upscaled Mini,"How many computers working together would you need to be faster than the world's best supercomputer? This week, the distributing computing project Folding at Home found out. Their software uses volunteer computers to analyze proteins, and once they turned their attention to the coronavirus, they saw a massive increase in new users. For the moment,their network has become the fastest supercomputer on Earth. Hopefully their results will help us understand the virus and better combat COVID-19. If you're looking for another project to support, also consider Rosetta, which does similar protein analysis.

AXP9qQ_a0fw,ICU Advantage,UC5ADeLt8ckSBvfz0C47qbGQ,1589088732.0,The COVID-19 Cytokine Storm Explained,"In this lesson we take a look at the Cytokine Storm that we are seeing in some of our COVID-19 patients.  This is a very serious complication that is developing in a subset of these patients and unfortunately is not having a good outcome for these patients.

I start off with Immunology 101 with a very quick overview of the immune system and specifically talking about what cytokines are, the different types of cytokines as well as what some of these cytokine do. I make mention of some of the cytokines that appear to be playing specific roles in this cytokine storm.

Next I explain more about the cytokine storm and what that actually means for our patients and what is happening with the immune system when they have this reaction. I also walk through a basic overview of the progression of the immune response, leading to the cytokine storm, as well as the effects that it has on the body.

From there we talk about the different tests that can help us to identify or diagnose that our patients are experiencing this cytokine storm, or at risk to do so.  Unfortunately we don't have any objective test.  Finally I talk a little about the treatment and some of the potential medications that are being looked at to prevent or possible lessen the impact of this hyper-inflammatory response.

Dr. Sophia Lunt explains how she intends to cut off cancer cells' survival potential, and pioneer a new way of halting their growth.

Dr. Sophia Lunt began her training in metabolism at Princeton University, where she received her Ph.D. studying the metabolic consequences of the antibiotic drug trimethoprim. As a postdoctoral fellow at MIT, she  focused on cancer metabolism, and was awarded the CDMRP PRCRP Visionary Postdoctoral Fellowship from the Department of Defense to support her research. She currently runs a research lab focused on cancer metabolism at Michigan State University.

Hallmarks of cancer
8 fundamental changes
Protooncogenes , oncogenes & Oncoproteins
Role of Oncogenes in cancer

Definition

A disorder of cell growth

Triggered by a series of acquired mutations

Affecting a single cell and its clonal progeny
HALLMARKS OF CANCER
1. Self sufficiency in the growth Signals
2. Insensitivity to antigrowth/ growth inhibitory signals
3.Evasion of Apoptosis
4. Limitless Replicative Potential
5. Sustained Angiogenesis
6. The Ability to invade and Metastasize
7. Reprogramming Energy Metabolism
8. Evasion of Immune System
enablers
9. Genomic Instability
10.Tumor promoting inflammation

SELF SUFFICIENCY IN GROWTH SIGNALS
Oncogenes: They promote unregulated proliferation/Autonomous cell growth
(Self sufficiency in growth signals)
 The unmutated counterparts of Oncogenes are “proto oncogenes”
Growth factors: Cancer cells develop growth self sufficiency ( Synthesize self responsive growth factors)
Eg: a. PDGF – Glioblastomas
      b. TGF-α – Sarcomas
      c.  FGF – Breast ca
2. Growth factor receptors:Cancer cells encode for growth factro receptors.
 a. EGF-receptor family: ERB-B1 (overexpression) Squamous cell carcinoma
 b. CSF-1 receptor: FMS (point mutation) – Leukemia
 c. PGDF receptor: PGDF-R (overexpression) - Gliomas
3. Signal transduction proteins – Receive growth promoting signals.
Eg. RAS family (point mutation) – Ca colon, lung. Pancreas
4. Nuclear regulatory proteins: Transcriptional activators 
Eg: C-MYC (translocated) – Burkitt lymphoma
      N-MYC (Amplification) – Ca lung,

5. Cell cycle regulatory proteins:
 Eg: Cyclin D (Translocation) Ca breast, Ca esophagus
     CDK4 (Amplification) Melanoma

Tumor suppression genes- general aspects
Retinoblastoma gene
Knudson’s two Hit Hypothesis
Role of RB in regulation of cell cycle
Mechanism of inactivation of RB
Tumors associated with RB gene mutations
Tumor suppressor proteins( products of TSG)
Regulate cell growth by applying brakes to cell proliferation ( Growth Inhibition)
Failure of growth inhibition is seen in carcinogenesis
Loss of function of these genes is a key event in carcinogenesis 

Retinoblastoma Gene ( RB Gene)
First discovered Tumor suppressor gene
Chromosome 13q14
Retinoblastoma:  is a childhood tumor with inactivation of this gene.
Knudson’s two-hit hypothesis
Two mutations ( hits) involving both the alleles  of TSG  ( here RB gene) is a basic requisite for the development of tumor
Retinoblastoma can occur as hereditary or sporadic form
Explanation for the same is given by Knudson’s two-hit hypothesis
RB protein- product of RB gene
Key role in regulation of the cell cycle
“Governor” of the cell cycle
So, How does RB gets inactivated ?OrHow does the Antiproliferative activity of RB is nullified?

1.       Germline & somatic
    Loss of function Mutations of RB Gene
2. Gene Amplifications of CDK 4 and
Cyclin D genes
3. Functional  inactivation of RB
Tumors associated with RB Gene mutations 
Retinoblastoma
Osteosarcoma
Glioblastomas
Small cell carcinomas of lung
Breast cancers &

p53 GENE
This is a tumor suppressor gene ( its activity stops the formation of tumors)
Located on 17p13, first discovered in 1979
The p53 protein is the product of p53 gene

P-protein
53- weight of the protein, 53 kDa
Located in almost all normal tissues
Unstable and degrades very quickly
Is one of the most commonly mutated gene in cancer
Function 
Regulation of Cell cycle
DNA repair
Apoptosis

Prevents neoplastic transformation either by cell cycle arrest or by triggering apoptosis.
In cases of DNA damage, there is triggering of expression of p53  gene whcich increases the production of p53 proteins. These preoteins Prevent Cell from entering  S phase of cell cycle
and Allows time for the DNA repair to take place. also p53 induces DNA repair genes. If the DNA is repaired,the p53 degrades and the cell cycle continues. if the DNA is not repaired, the  p53 induces permanent arrest in the cell or activates pro apoptotic proteins bax and bad thereby promoting apoptosis. By these mechanisms, it is understood that the p53 conserves the stability of the cell and thus aptly called as ' THE GAURDIAN OF THE GENOME""
How p53 causes cell cycl arrest?
P53 is the transcriptional regulator of  one  of the genes named WAF 1  
 Resulting  in increased  WAF proteins named as p 21
P21 blocks CDK4/CyclinD complex ….. Cell cycle is halted in G1 stage resulting in cell cycle arrest.
Regulation of p53 protein: by formation of p53 and mdme protein complex which is degraded by ubiquitin mediated pathway.
What happens when p53 is inactivated?
There will be  no cell cycle arrest in cases of damaged DNA and the cell cycle progresses with damaged DNa which results in genomic instability and the neoplastic transformation.
How p53 is inactivated??
Mutations
 Heterozygous and homozygous loss of alleles
What are the cancers associated with p53 mutations??
Most human cancers!
MC breast, colorectal, liver, lung, and ovarian cancers.

Tumor suppressor genes are constitutively produced in cell that regulates cell cycle stages and make the decision to either fix any DNA damage or to kill the cell with apoptosis pathway. Tumor suppressor genes are normal genes that slow down cell division, repair DNA mistakes, or tell cells when to die (a process known as apoptosis or programmed cell death). When tumor suppressor genes don't work properly, cells can grow out of control, which can lead to cancer.

5of1K-pyEjA,Hussain Biology,UCDCg5AAslixldHh5D7Nu6-g,1597121510.0,Proto-Oncogenes and Oncogenes,"A proto-oncogene is a normal gene that could become an oncogene due to mutations or increased expression. Proto-oncogenes code for proteins that help to regulate the cell growth and differentiation. Proto-oncogenes are often involved in signal transduction and execution of mitogenic signals, usually through their protein products. Upon acquiring an activating mutation, a proto-oncogene becomes a tumor-inducing agent, an oncogene.Examples of proto-oncogenes include RAS, WNT, MYC, ERK, and TRK. The MYC gene is implicated in Burkitt's lymphoma, which starts when a chromosomal translocation moves an enhancer sequence within the vicinity of the MYC gene. The MYC gene codes for widely used transcription factors. When the enhancer sequence is wrongly placed, these transcription factors are produced at much higher rates. Another example of an oncogene is the Bcr-Abl gene found on the Philadelphia chromosome, a piece of genetic material seen in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia caused by the translocation of pieces from chromosomes 9 and 22. Bcr-Abl codes for a tyrosine kinase, which is constitutively active, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. (More information about the Philadelphia Chromosome below)An oncogene is a gene that has the potential to cause cancer. In tumor cells, these genes are often mutated, or expressed at high levels.

Most normal cells will undergo a programmed form of rapid cell death (apoptosis) when critical functions are altered and malfunctioning. Activated oncogenes can cause those cells designated for apoptosis to survive and proliferate instead.[3] Most oncogenes began as proto-oncogenes: normal genes involved in cell growth and proliferation or inhibition of apoptosis. If, through mutation, normal genes promoting cellular growth are up-regulated (gain-of-function mutation), they will predispose the cell to cancer; thus, they are termed ""oncogenes"". Usually multiple oncogenes, along with mutated apoptotic or tumor suppressor genes will all act in concert to cause cancer.

The proto-oncogene can become an oncogene by a relatively small modification of its original function. There are three basic methods of activation:

A mutation within a proto-oncogene, or within a regulatory region (for example the promoter region), can cause a change in the protein structure, causing
an increase in protein (enzyme) activity
a loss of regulation
An increase in the amount of a certain protein (protein concentration), caused by
an increase of protein expression (through misregulation)
an increase of protein (mRNA) stability, prolonging its existence and thus its activity in the cell
gene duplication (one type of chromosome abnormality), resulting in an increased amount of protein in the cell
A chromosomal translocation (another type of chromosome abnormality)
There are 2 different types of chromosomal translocations that can occur:
translocation events which relocate a proto-oncogene to a new chromosomal site that leads to higher expression
translocation events that lead to a fusion between a proto-oncogene and a 2nd gene (this creates a fusion protein with increased cancerous/oncogenic activity)",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5of1K-pyEjA/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:06.472948

C-Njz_iSvLI,Oncology for Medical Students,UC4o5maOsEr7erAVgZGDKsJg,1462179665.0,"6. Tumour Suppressor Genes (Retinoblastoma and the two hit hypothesis, p53)","Cancers occur as a result of damage (in the form of mutations) to a cells DNA that results in the formation of malfunctioning proteins. The mutated proteins give the cancerous cells a number of specific traits, outlined in the 'hallmarks of cancer' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea-CALtn7hA).

The genes that are mutated in cancers can be divided into two groups - tumour suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes. 

Tumour suppressor genes are genes that produce proteins that are involved in stopping mutated cells from dividing, and also act as the brakes on the cell cycle at its various checkpoints.

The retinoblastoma gene is a gene that is involved in stopping cells from crossing the G1 checkpoint in the cell cycle, preventing cells from entering S phase and replicating their DNA in preparation for cell division.

For the retinoblastoma gene to be rendered inactive, it needs a mutation in both of its copies (alleles). This is explained by the 'two hit hypothesis'.

P53 is another example of a significant tumour suppressor gene. It is active during the cell cycle, acting by halting damaged cells at the checkpoints and then ordering the cell to destroy itself by the process of apoptosis.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C-Njz_iSvLI/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:06.704400

nEMMKzYQf9A,Neural Academy,UCqKiDBaeIA61KZxUqWHNb6w,1525231839.0,Cyclins and CDKs Cell Cycle Regulation,"A cell can switch from G0, or cell cycle arrest, to G1 once cells have attained a critical size. For multicellular organisms, growth factors and mitogens, which are substances encouraging cell division, need to be present. For unicellular organisms, nutrients must be adequate in surroundings. Once G1 is initiated, Cyclin D is synthesized and drives the G1/S phase transition.
In eukaryotes, Cyclin D binds with CDK 4 and CDK 6. These two complexes can partially phosphorylate retinoblastoma tumour suppressor protein, or Rb for short. Rb is bound to E2F, a transcription factor. When the CD-CDK4 and CD-CDK6 complexes partially phosphorylate Rb, it loosens its grip on E2F. E2F can then activate transcription of the cyclin E gene. Cyclin E binds CDK2, and this complex fully phosphorylates Rb, completing its inactivation. 
Cyclin E also phosphorylates p27Kip1, an inhibitor of Cyclin D. Phosphorylation of p27Kip1 tags it for degradation. Degradation of this protein promotes expression of cyclin A. E2F also promotes transcription of cyclin A by removing the repressor molecule cell-cycle-responsive element (or CCRE) from the promotor, allowing the cell to enter S phase. The action of E2F on Cyclin A expression is part of a negative feedback loop, since the Cyclin A-CDK2 complex phosphorylates E2F, preventing it from removing the repressor molecule.
Cyclin A is the ONLY cyclin that plays a role in regulation of two cell cycle stages. It can activate two CDKs – CDK2 and CDK1. When Cyclin A forms a complex with CDK2, it allows the cell to progress to S phase. Meanwhile, binding of Cyclin A to CDK1 allows entry into M phase.
During S phase, Cyclin A resides in the nucleus.  It directs the initiation and completion of DNA replication. Critically, Cyclin A ensures that DNA replication only occurs ONCE per cell cycle by preventing assembly of excessive replication complexes. How does it accomplish this?   
Well, remember how Cyclin E is around at the end of G1? One way in which it helps the cell move into S phase is by initiating assembly of the pre-replication complex. This complex is needed for DNA replication to occur, and forms at the origin of replication. However, Cyclin A also associates with CDK2, and replaces Cyclin E. Once the Cyclin A-CDK2 complex concentration reaches a critical threshold, assembly of the pre-replication complex is terminated. The Cyclin A-CDK2 complex also regulates DNA replication by phosphorylating certain DNA replication machinery components.
Later in the S phase, Cyclin A also forms a complex with CDK1, remaining bound until late in the G2 phase, when it is replaced by cyclin B. The Cyclin A-CDK1 complex is believed to aid in activation and stabilization of the Cyclin B-CDK1 complex before being ubiquitinated. This degradation of the Cyclin A-CDK1 complex induces mitotic exit – in other words, the end of mitosis.
Cyclin B is a mitotic cyclin which binds to CDK1 to form the maturation promoting factor, or mitosis promoting factor – abbreviated MPF. The concentration of MPF rises until mitosis, until its concentration falls abruptly due to degradation of Cyclin B. High concentrations of Cyclin B are necessary for cells to enter M phase, and low concentrations are needed to exit M phase.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nEMMKzYQf9A/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:07.125083

Helen Piwnica-Worms provides a historical perspective on cell cycle regulation and outlines important experiments that revealed crucial mediators of the cell cycle.

Part 1: Frogs, Clams, Yeast & Human Cancer: Historical Perspective on Cell Cycle Regulation: Helen Piwnica-Worms provides a historical perspective on cell cycle regulation and outlines important experiments that revealed crucial mediators of the cell cycle.

Part 2: Translating Fundamental Cell Cycle Principles to Targeted Cancer Therapies: Helen Piwnica-Worms explains how scientists have used their understanding of the cell cycle regulation to generate targeted cancer therapies. 

Talk Overview:
In her first talk, Dr. Helen Piwnica-Worms provides a historical perspective on cell cycle regulation and outlines important experiments in frogs, clams, and yeast that revealed crucial mediators of the cell cycle. Scientists observed that there were factors that allowed cell cycle progression, while there were other factors that prevented the cell from going backward. Using these model organisms, scientists were able to characterize the activation of the inducer of mitosis, the M-Phase promoting factor, which is a heterodimer between cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdc2/Cdk1) and cyclin B.   

In her second talk, Piwnica-Worms explains how scientists have used their understanding of the cell cycle regulation to generate targeted cancer therapies. The cell has proteins that serve as cell cycle checkpoints, which allows the cell to respond appropriately to DNA damage. Although not all of the checkpoints are functional in a cancer cell, these cells still need the checkpoint proteins to respond to DNA damage. Piwnica-Worms’ laboratory studies the use of combining DNA damage agents with checkpoint inhibitors to selectively kill cancer cells. Her laboratory developed a patient-derived xenograft mouse model to study Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), and predict how the genotype of the tumor affects treatment.

Speaker Biography:
Dr. Helen Piwnica-Worms is professor of experimental radiation oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. She completed her bachelor’s degree in Biology at St. Olaf College in 1979, a doctoral degree in microbiology and immunology at Duke University Medical School in 1984, and a postdoctoral fellowship in pathology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in 1988. In 1989, Piwnica-Worms joined the faculty of Tufts University Medical School, and in 1992 she moved to the Microbiology and Molecular Genetics department at Harvard Medical School. In 1994, she joined the faculty at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, where she was the chair of Cell Biology and Physiology. Since 2013, Piwnica-Worms assumed the role of Vice Provost of Science and Professor of Experimental Radiation Oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.
 
As a basic research scientist, she was interested in understanding how the cell cycle was regulated. She showed how basic research discoveries allow for a better understanding of molecular underpinnings that opens new strategies to treat diseases, like cancer. Using immunocompromised mice, her laboratory developed a mouse model to perform preclinical studies using breast cancer cells from patients. For her scientific contributions, she was an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute from 1994 to 2011 and was elected as a member of the National Academy of Medicine in 2013.

y3ST0whbA4k,iBiology,UCsvqEZBO-kNmwuDBbKbfL6A,1554878811.0,Jeannie Lee (Harvard) 1 - X Chromosome Inactivation: Making and Breaking the Silence,"https://www.ibiology.org/development-and-stem-cells/x-chromosome-inactivation

The X chromosome is many time larger than the Y chromosome. To compensate for this genetic inequality, female mammalian cells undergo X chromosome inactivation of one X chromosome. Dr. Jeannie Lee explains the how and why of X chromosome inactivation.

Talk Overview:
In mammals, sex is determined by a pair of unequal sex chromosomes.  Genetically male mammals have an X and a Y chromosome while genetically female mammals have two X chromosomes.  The X chromosome is many times larger than the Y chromosome. To compensate for this genetic inequality, female mammals undergo X chromosome inactivation in which one of the X chromosomes is randomly chosen to be silenced. X chromosome inactivation has been studied for over 50 years both because it is a physiologically important event and because it is an excellent model for studying epigenetic silencing of genes by long non-coding RNAs. In her first talk, Dr. Jeannie Lee gives an overview of the steps a cell must go through during X inactivation. These include “counting” the X chromosomes, deciding which X chromosome to inactivate, initiating the inactivation and spreading it across the chromosome, and finally maintaining inactivation of the same X chromosome for the rest of the life of the organism.  

In her second talk, Lee elaborates on the early steps of X inactivation. Very early in development, cells “count” the number of X chromosomes and decide if one needs to be inactivated, and if so which one.  There is a region of the X chromosome called the X inactivation center which is enriched in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).  Lee explains how she and others showed that by sensing the ratio of two specific lncRNAs the cell can determine how many X chromosomes are present.  Further studies showed that two different lncRNAs are responsible for randomly determining which X chromosome will be inactivated. Finally, she discusses the hypothesis that the allelic choice mechanism depends on a transient chromosomal pairing event that occurs at the beginning of the dosage compensation process.

And in her last talk, Lee describes how X inactivation is nucleated and spreads across the X chromosome.  The Xist lncRNA is known to be necessary and sufficient for X inactivation.  Lee describes experiments that identified the factors that tether Xist to the X chromosome and showed how Xist spreads to cover the entire X chromosome. She then goes on to explain that Xist blocks transcription in three ways: 1) Xist recruits factors that repress transcription via epigenetic modification such as histone methylation 2) Xist repels factors that open chromatin preparing it for transcription and 3) Xist changes the 3 dimensional organization of chromosomes. Lee ends with a model of our current understanding of the complex but critical process of X chromosome inactivation.  

Speaker Biography:
Dr. Jeannie Lee is a Professor in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and in the Department of Molecular Biology at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Her lab uses X chromosome inactivation as a model to study epigenetic regulation by long noncoding RNAs.

Lee received her AB in biochemistry and molecular biology from Harvard University and her MD/PhD from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.  She was a postdoctoral fellow at the Whitehead Institute and a resident at MGH before joining Harvard/MGH as a faculty member in 1997.  Lee was also an HHMI Investigator from 2001-2018. She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  Lee has been honored with numerous awards including the 2016 Centennial Prize from the Genetics Society of America, the 2016 Lurie Prize from the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, and the 2010 Molecular Biology Award from the National Academy of Sciences.  In 2018, she was President of the Genetics Society of America.

In the first of his videos, Dr. Allis introduces the concept of epigenetics; a change in a cellular phenotype that is not due to DNA mutation but due to chemical modifications of proteins that result in changes in gene activation.  In the nucleus, DNA is wrapped around proteins called histones to form chromatin. How tightly the chromatin is packaged determines whether genes are active or not.  This switch between the “on and off” state of chromatin is regulated by chemical modification of histones.  Allis describes work from his lab and others that identified the enzymes that add, remove and recognize the histone modifications.  Changes in histone modification can cause a number of diseases including cancer. A key difference between genetic mutations and epigenetic modifications is that epigenetic changes are reversible making them an attractive drug target.

Dr. Allis focuses on the role of epigenetics in development and disease in his second talk.  Histones can be modified on a number of amino acids, particularly lysines, by the addition of acetyl or methyl groups.  Combinatorial patterns of these modifications act to enhance or repress gene expression. Allis describes work from his lab and others, which demonstrates that mutations in histone (for instance a lysine to methionine mutation) may block these modifications and, thus, impact gene expression.  Sadly, these “onco-histone” mutations have been identified as the cause of many diseases including pediatric brain tumors and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. 

Speaker Biography:
C. David Allis is the Joy and Jack Fishman Professor and Head of the Laboratory of Chromatin Biology and Epigenetics at The Rockefeller University.  Allis’ lab studies how modifications to histones, the proteins that package DNA, influence gene expression and the implications these changes have for human disease.  

Allis has been honored with many awards for his pioneering research including the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, the 2014 Japan Prize, the 2007 Canada Gairdner International Award and many others. Allis is a member of the National Academy of Sciences USA, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the French Academy of Sciences.

Part 1: Compartmentalization of Proteins Inside Cells: Hegde reviews key historical experiments that have informed our understanding protein localization within a cell. 

Part 2: Quality Control of Protein Localization: Mislocalization of proteins can have devastating effects for the entire organism. Hegde explains how cells detect and degrade mislocalized proteins. 

Part 3: Recognition of Protein Localization Signals: How does the protein translocation machinery recognize thousands of distinct signal sequences and target proteins to cellular membranes or for secretion? 

Talk Overview:
Cells are organized into many different compartments such as the cytosol, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and mitochondria. Almost all proteins are made in the cytosol, yet each cellular compartment requires a specific set of proteins.  How does the cell regulate protein localization to be sure that proteins end up where they should? In his first lecture, Manu Hegde reviews the history of this field and highlights key experiments that have led to our current understanding of how protein localization occurs.

In his second lecture, Hegde explains that although the protein localization system usually operates accurately, it does sometimes fail.  This can be due to genetic mutations, stress within an organelle, or just intrinsic inefficiencies that accompany any complex process. As a graduate student, Hegde used a cell-free in vitro system to study the translocation of prion protein into the ER. He found that a small amount of prion protein did not completely cross the ER membrane as expected, but remained in a transmembrane form. Worried that this was an artifact of the in vitro system, he designed experiments in mice to see what the effect of an increase in mislocalized, transmembrane prion protein would be. He found a striking result - even a small increase in the amount of transmembrane prion protein caused increased neurodegeneration in mice. It turns out that incomplete translocation is not unique to prion protein. Hegde tells us how, as an independent investigator, his lab went on to investigate why this happens and how the cell monitors and degrades proteins that are not properly localized.

Proteins that are secreted from the cell or localized to the plasma membrane need first to be translocated into the lumen of the ER or inserted into the ER membrane. Thousands of proteins, each with a unique signal sequence, move through this pathway. How does the protein translocation machinery recognize these diverse signals and correctly localize the protein?  In his third talk, Hegde describes studies from his lab using cryo-electron microscopy to visualize the translocation machinery at different stages in the recognition and engagement of a secreted or membrane inserted protein. The structural information gleaned from these experiments helps to explain how the protein translocation machinery works with high fidelity even when it needs to recognize diverse signal sequences. 

Speaker Biography:
As an undergraduate, Ramanujan (Manu) Hegde studied biology at the University of Chicago with the thought that he would become a doctor.  His summers and spare time were spent working in a lab, where he came to love the problem-solving of basic research. Hegde then fled Chicago winters for the sunshine of The University of California, San Francisco, where he completed an MD-PhD combined degree program. By then, he had decided to pursue basic research as a career, and moved to the National Institutes of Health where he was an investigator for 11 years. In 2011, Hegde moved to the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, where his research focuses on the mechanisms of protein biosynthesis and quality control.

Hegde’s research contributions have been recognized with his election as a member of the European Molecular Biology Organization in 2013 and as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2016.

Bishop begins his lecture with a historical review of the experiments that resulted in the realization that cancer has a genetic basis.  He explains that mutations can cause normal cellular genes known as proto-oncogenes to become oncogenes, analogous to jammed accelerators causing uncontrolled cell division.  Alternatively, mutations in tumor suppressor genes are analogous to a failed brake system.

David Baltimore outlines the sequence of events that led to the Nobel Prize-winning discovery of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme that converts a sequence in an RNA molecule into a sequence in a DNA molecule.

Talk Overview:
The first video is a shortened version in which Dr. David Baltimore introduces the different types of viruses, and defines how viruses are classified depending on their genetic material. Using HIV as an example, Baltimore explains what constitutes an equilibrium versus a non-equilibrium virus, and shows how the discovery of the reverse transcriptase helped scientist understand viruses.

The second video is an extended edition in which Baltimore also outlines the sequence of events that led to the Nobel Prize-winning discovery of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme that converts a sequence in an RNA molecule into a sequence in a DNA molecule. As Baltimore explains, the discovery of reverse transcriptase has revolutionized modern molecular biology, and it has aided in the understanding of viruses like HIV, and the genetic basis of cancer.     

Speaker Biography: 
After serving as President of the California Institute of Technology for nine years, in 2006 David Baltimore was appointed President Emeritus and the Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Biology. Born in New York City, he received his B.A. in Chemistry from Swarthmore College in 1960 and a Ph.D. in 1964 from Rockefeller University, where he returned to serve as President from 1990-91 and faculty member until 1994.
 
For almost 30 years, Baltimore was a faculty member at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While his early work was on poliovirus, in 1970 he identified the enzyme reverse transcriptase in tumor virus particles, thus providing strong evidence for a process of RNA to DNA conversion, the existence of which had been hypothesized some years earlier. Baltimore and Howard Temin (with Renato Dulbecco, for related research) shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery, which provided the key to understanding the life-cycle of HIV. In the following years, he has contributed widely to the understanding of cancer, AIDS and the molecular basis of the immune response.
 
In addition to receiving the Nobel Prize, Baltimore's numerous honors include the 1999 National Medal of Science, election to the National Academy of Sciences in 1974, the Royal Society of London, and the French Academy of Sciences. Learn more about Baltimore’s research at his lab website:

Dr. Dipti Nayak explains how the mysterious microbes known as archaea are helping scientists rewrite the tree of life.

Before 1977, all life on Earth was classified into two groups: single-celled microorganisms and complex cellular life such as fungi, plants, and animals. A seminal discovery in 1977 rewrote the tree of life and introduced a whole new domain of organisms known as the archaea - mysterious microbes that are genetically distinct from bacteria. Fast forward to the 21st century, and again new discoveries about archaea are leading scientists to reshape the tree of life and rewrite the evolutionary history of complex organisms. Dr. Dipti Nayak introduces the fascinating organisms known as archaea and explains how they are helping scientists answer the question ""Where do we come from?"".

fkuHZj15JHw,Mark Temple,UCYtiR9XcY0kUagbkgJW0kVg,1502410760.0,3.7 pRb and the Cell Cycle,"pRb undergoes phosphorylation through the cell cycle. 
pRb is essentially unphosphorylated when cells are in Go
becomes weakly phosphorlated after entrance into G1
becomes extensively phosphorlated on a much larger number of serine and threonin residues in concert with advance of cells through the R point 
pRb usually remains hyperphosphorlated throughout the remainder of the cell cycle. 
After cells exit mitosis, the phosphate groups on pRb are stripped off 

pRb function is disrupted by onco-proteins
DNA tumor virus encoded onco-protein can disrupt the cellular cycle

E1A oncogene of adenovirus is tightly bound to pRb 

E7 onco-protein of human papillomavirus virus (human cervical carcinoma) also binds with pRb in virus-transformed cells 
the Rb gene protein product, pRb, must inhibit  proliferation in some fashion??? 
DNA tumor viruses can sequester and apparently inactivating pRb
The same outcome as that occurs after loses the two copies of its chromosomal Rb gene through mutations. 

DNA tumor viruses proteins bind preferentially to the hypo-phosphorylated pRb, present in the cell through most in G1 phase

pRb - the guardian of the R-point
pRb is deployed by the cell cycle clock to serve as a guardian of the restriction-point gate until it becomes hyperphosphoylated in which case pRb loses its growth-inhibitory powers, opens the gate

cell to enter into late G1 and thereafter into the remaining phases of the cell cycle. 

pRb is the arbiter of growth versus nongrowth 
In early and mid-G1, D-type cyclins with their CDK4/6 kinase partners are responsible for initiating pRb phorylation leading to its hypo-phosphorylation. 
cyclin E levels increase dramatically at the R point. 
The cyclin E then associates with its CDK2 partner, and this complex drives pRb phosphorylation to completion,
pRb becomes hyperphosphorylated, functionally inactive

E2F transcription factors bind to pRb
pRb exercises much of this control through its effects on transcription factors termed E2Fs. 

When pRb are unphosphorylated (hypophosphorylated), they bind E2Fs, 
when hyperphosphorylated, pRb dissociate from the E2Fs

A simple model of how pRb is able to control cell cycle
In early and middle parts of G1, E2Fs are associated with the promoters of a number of genes under their control. 
these transcription factors are bound by pocket proteins (eg. pRb)
This pRb protein association with promoter and prevents the transcription. 

During much of the G1 phase of the cell cycle, genes that depend on E2Fs for expression is repressed (by pRb/E2F)

E2F release allows transcription
When the pocket proteins undergo hyper-phosphorylion at the R point in late G1, they release their grip on the E2Fs
 - permitting the E2F transcription of these genes. 
The products of these genes, push the cell from late G1 into S phase. 

Similarly, when viral oncoproteins are present, they mimic pRb hyper-phosphorylation by prevent pRb from binding E2Fs

What sort of genes are transcribed?
Genes known or assumed to be important for S-phase entry have promoters for E2Fs. 

Genes encoding proteins involved in;
 - synthesizing DNA, 
 - precursor nucleotides (such as dihydrofolate synthetase and thymidine kinase)
 - other genes involved directly in DNA replication. 
 
E2F deactivation 
As the cell passes G1/S transition into S phase, Cyclin A becomes activated and with its CDK2 partner. This phosphroylates both the E2F and DP subunits of these heterodimeric transcription factors results in the dissociation of the E2F-DP complexes and loss of their transcription-activating abilities.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fkuHZj15JHw/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:08.297396

Proper chromosome segregation during cell division is critical to ensure that daughter cells inherit the correct number of chromosomes.  Microtubules emanating from the spindle poles pull on sister chromatids to move one chromosome to each pole.  The kinetochore, a protein complex on the chromosome, is key to regulating chromosome segregation.  Kinetochores form attachments to microtubule ends (no easy feat since microtubules are constantly growing and shrinking), they sense tension to ensure that sister chromatids are connected to microtubules from opposite poles, and they signal the cell to stop cell division if attachment is not correct.  Biggins gives an excellent overview of kinetochore structure and its critical functions in chromosome segregation.

When Biggins began working on kinetochores, the experiments that she could do were limited by the lack of a method to purify intact kinetochores.  In Part 2 of her talk, Biggins explains how her lab purified kinetochores from yeast (for the first time ever!).  They showed that the purified protein complex functioned in the same manner in vitro as endogenous kinetochores.  Using electron microscopy and other techniques, Biggins and her collaborators were able to visualize the structure of the kinetochore-microtubule attachment and demonstrate, surprisingly, that tension directly stabilizes the attachment.

Speaker Biography:
Dr. Sue Biggins studied biology as an undergraduate at Stanford University and initially thought she would apply to medical school after receiving her degree.  However, after a summer working in a research lab, she changed her mind and decided to apply to graduate school.  Biggins received her PhD in molecular biology from Princeton and was a post-doctoral fellow with Andrew Murray at the University of California, San Francisco.  
Currently, Biggins is a Principal Investigator in the Division of Basic Sciences at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.  Her lab studies the kinetochore and how it regulates chromosome segregation.  Chromosome mis-segregation results in aneuploidy, a common hallmark of cancer as well hereditary birth defects.
Biggins’ groundbreaking research has been recognized with numerous honors.  In 2013, Biggins received the National Academy of Sciences Award in Molecular Biology and the Hutchinson Center McDougall Mentoring Award.  In 2015, she was awarded the Novitski Prize from the Genetics Society of America, and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.

PEZqys5Rc-M,iBiology,UCsvqEZBO-kNmwuDBbKbfL6A,1558159937.0,"Tom Rapoport (Harvard, HHMI) 1: Organelle Biosynthesis and Protein Sorting","https://www.ibiology.org/cell-biology/protein-sorting

Eukaryotic cells have many different membrane-bound organelles with distinct functions and characteristic shapes.  How does this happen?  Dr. Tom Rapoport explains the important role of protein sorting in determining organelle shape and function. 

In his first talk, Dr. Tom Rapoport explains that eukaryotic cells contain many membrane-bound organelles each of which has a characteristic shape and distinctive functions that are carried out by specific proteins. Most proteins are made in the cytosol but must move to different cellular destinations.  Protein sorting is determined by signal sequences on the proteins that act as “zip codes”. Many proteins sort first to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before moving to other intracellular organelles or the plasma membrane. Rapoport explains that as a protein is translated, its signal sequence causes the nascent protein to insert into the Sec61 channel on the ER membrane. The polypeptide segment following the signal sequence will then be translocated across the membrane. Solving the structure of Sec61 channel allowed Rapoport’s lab to understand how proteins, which are typically hydrophilic, can be transported across a lipid membrane. It also helped them determine how Sec 61 differentiates between secreted proteins which need to be released into the ER lumen and transmembrane proteins which need to be anchored in the ER membrane. This improved knowledge of protein sorting helps us to better understand how organelles are formed and how they function.

The ER is a vast network that includes different domains with different functions. The rough ER consists of sheets with associated ribosomes and is involved in protein translation.  The smooth ER consists of tubules and is important for lipid synthesis and Ca2+ transport. In his second talk, Rapoport explains how his lab identified proteins needed to generate and maintain a tubular ER network. They found two families of proteins that are required to form the high membrane curvature of tubules, and membrane-bound GTPases that fuse the tubules together into a network. The tubule-shaping proteins are also important in forming the edges of the ER sheets. In mammalian cells, however, another set of proteins is required to act as spacers between the membrane sheets.  Using ultra-thin section electron microscopy, Rapoport’s lab, in collaboration with others, was able to show that stacked ER sheets are held together by helicoidal membrane connections forming a “parking-garage” like structure.

In this talk, Dr. Howard Chang describes epigenomic approaches pioneered by his lab and the role of long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating gene expression.

In Part 1 of this series, Dr. Howard Chang introduces epigenomics, the study of DNA regulatory mechanisms that determine which genes are turned on or off in cells at specific times. The epigenome integrates signals from the environment to modify expression of the DNA blueprint inherited from an individual’s parents. Chang’s lab has pioneered techniques to map the landscape of chromatin, the complex of DNA, RNA and protein that organizes the genome and regulates gene expression. One example is ATAC, the Assay of Transposase Accessible Chromatin, which uses a bacterial transposase to mark open chromatin and identify genes that are likely turned “on”.

In his Part 2, Chang introduces long noncoding RNAs, or lncRNAs. As their name suggests, lncRNAs are not translated into proteins, and initially their functions were poorly understood. Chang’s group has developed technologies to better understand the function of lncRNAs. For example, his lab characterized the protein partners that interact with Xist, a canonical lncRNA that mediates X chromosome inactivation. They found that the protein Spen is necessary for X chromosome silencing. Interestingly, Spen has likely been co-opted by mammalian cells to inactivate the X chromosome via viral mimicry.

In his Part 3, Chang reminds us that every lncRNA gene has its own set of DNA regulatory elements, such as enhancers and promoters. These regulatory elements can confer functionality to lncRNA genes. Chang shares the research story of a mysterious lncRNA known as PVT1, which is frequently co-amplified with the proto-oncogene MYC in human cancers. His group found that PVT1 promoter activity is inversely correlated with MYC expression - when one is up, the other is down. Finally, Chang shows that the PVT1 and MYC promoters compete for four enhancers located within the PVT1 gene locus.

The X chromosome is many time larger than the Y chromosome. To compensate for this genetic inequality, female mammalian cells undergo X chromosome inactivation of one X chromosome. Dr. Jeannie Lee explains the how and why of X chromosome inactivation.

Talk Overview:
In mammals, sex is determined by a pair of unequal sex chromosomes.  Genetically male mammals have an X and a Y chromosome while genetically female mammals have two X chromosomes.  The X chromosome is many times larger than the Y chromosome. To compensate for this genetic inequality, female mammals undergo X chromosome inactivation in which one of the X chromosomes is randomly chosen to be silenced. X chromosome inactivation has been studied for over 50 years both because it is a physiologically important event and because it is an excellent model for studying epigenetic silencing of genes by long non-coding RNAs. In her first talk, Dr. Jeannie Lee gives an overview of the steps a cell must go through during X inactivation. These include “counting” the X chromosomes, deciding which X chromosome to inactivate, initiating the inactivation and spreading it across the chromosome, and finally maintaining inactivation of the same X chromosome for the rest of the life of the organism.  

In her second talk, Lee elaborates on the early steps of X inactivation. Very early in development, cells “count” the number of X chromosomes and decide if one needs to be inactivated, and if so which one.  There is a region of the X chromosome called the X inactivation center which is enriched in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).  Lee explains how she and others showed that by sensing the ratio of two specific lncRNAs the cell can determine how many X chromosomes are present.  Further studies showed that two different lncRNAs are responsible for randomly determining which X chromosome will be inactivated. Finally, she discusses the hypothesis that the allelic choice mechanism depends on a transient chromosomal pairing event that occurs at the beginning of the dosage compensation process.

And in her last talk, Lee describes how X inactivation is nucleated and spreads across the X chromosome.  The Xist lncRNA is known to be necessary and sufficient for X inactivation.  Lee describes experiments that identified the factors that tether Xist to the X chromosome and showed how Xist spreads to cover the entire X chromosome. She then goes on to explain that Xist blocks transcription in three ways: 1) Xist recruits factors that repress transcription via epigenetic modification such as histone methylation 2) Xist repels factors that open chromatin preparing it for transcription and 3) Xist changes the 3 dimensional organization of chromosomes. Lee ends with a model of our current understanding of the complex but critical process of X chromosome inactivation.  

Speaker Biography:
Dr. Jeannie Lee is a Professor in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and in the Department of Molecular Biology at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Her lab uses X chromosome inactivation as a model to study epigenetic regulation by long noncoding RNAs.

Lee received her AB in biochemistry and molecular biology from Harvard University and her MD/PhD from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.  She was a postdoctoral fellow at the Whitehead Institute and a resident at MGH before joining Harvard/MGH as a faculty member in 1997.  Lee was also an HHMI Investigator from 2001-2018. She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  Lee has been honored with numerous awards including the 2016 Centennial Prize from the Genetics Society of America, the 2016 Lurie Prize from the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, and the 2010 Molecular Biology Award from the National Academy of Sciences.  In 2018, she was President of the Genetics Society of America.

David Baltimore outlines the sequence of events that led to the Nobel Prize-winning discovery of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme that converts a sequence in an RNA molecule into a sequence in a DNA molecule.

Talk Overview:
The first video is a shortened version in which Dr. David Baltimore introduces the different types of viruses, and defines how viruses are classified depending on their genetic material. Using HIV as an example, Baltimore explains what constitutes an equilibrium versus a non-equilibrium virus, and shows how the discovery of the reverse transcriptase helped scientist understand viruses.

The second video is an extended edition in which Baltimore also outlines the sequence of events that led to the Nobel Prize-winning discovery of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme that converts a sequence in an RNA molecule into a sequence in a DNA molecule. As Baltimore explains, the discovery of reverse transcriptase has revolutionized modern molecular biology, and it has aided in the understanding of viruses like HIV, and the genetic basis of cancer.     

Speaker Biography: 
After serving as President of the California Institute of Technology for nine years, in 2006 David Baltimore was appointed President Emeritus and the Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Biology. Born in New York City, he received his B.A. in Chemistry from Swarthmore College in 1960 and a Ph.D. in 1964 from Rockefeller University, where he returned to serve as President from 1990-91 and faculty member until 1994.
 
For almost 30 years, Baltimore was a faculty member at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While his early work was on poliovirus, in 1970 he identified the enzyme reverse transcriptase in tumor virus particles, thus providing strong evidence for a process of RNA to DNA conversion, the existence of which had been hypothesized some years earlier. Baltimore and Howard Temin (with Renato Dulbecco, for related research) shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery, which provided the key to understanding the life-cycle of HIV. In the following years, he has contributed widely to the understanding of cancer, AIDS and the molecular basis of the immune response.
 
In addition to receiving the Nobel Prize, Baltimore's numerous honors include the 1999 National Medal of Science, election to the National Academy of Sciences in 1974, the Royal Society of London, and the French Academy of Sciences. Learn more about Baltimore’s research at his lab website:

Part 2: Virus Adaptation to Environmental Change: Turner’s laboratory uses experimental evolution to study how viruses adapt to environmental changes. 
 
Part 3: Phage Therapy: Turner provides an introduction to phage therapy, and how it can be improved by applying ‘evolution thinking’.


Talk Overview:
In his first lecture, Dr. Paul Turner describes the fundamental biology of viruses, how they interact with their host organisms, and how they might have originally evolved long ago. He provides an overview of the many reasons why viruses might be considered the most biologically successful inhabitants of earth, including their ability to rapidly reproduce, and adapt to environmental challenges. Turner explains how viruses have impacted human history, as well as earth’s history, due to their prevalent interactions with other species.       

Viruses have an incredible capacity to adapt to environmental challenges, but sometimes, the environment constraints viral adaptation. Turner’s laboratory uses experimental evolution to study how viruses adapt to environmental changes (e.g. temperature changes), and the mechanisms by which viruses jump to novel host species. Turner’s work suggests that viruses with greater capacities to block the innate immune systems of their hosts, also have a greater likelihood of emerging on new host species. Also, he describes how virus adaptation to environmental change may be constraints by trade-offs: viruses can evolve either greater reproduction or greater survival, but not both simultaneously.

Before antibiotics were discovered, scientists were using viruses of bacteria, bacteriophages, to treat bacterial infections in humans. Given the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, scientists are revisiting the idea of using phage therapy to treat infections. In his third lecture, Turner provides an introduction to phage therapy, and how it can be improved by applying ‘evolution thinking’. His laboratory discovered phage OMKO1 that can treat multi-drug resistant bacteria in human patients while causing these bacteria to evolve greater sensitivity to antibiotics.

Speaker Biography:
Dr. Paul Turner is Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University, and holds an appointment in the Microbiology Program at Yale School of Medicine. His laboratory studies how viruses evolutionarily adapt to overcome environmental challenges, such as temperature changes or infection of novel host species.

Lecture Overview:
In this set of lectures, I describe the threat facing the world from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a bold proposal on how we might meet the challenge of eliminating this disease by engineering the immune system.

In part 1, I provide a broad introduction to viruses, describing their basic properties and my own history of studying the replication of RNA viruses which led to the discovery of reverse transcriptase. I also illustrate the distinguishing features of equilibrium viruses (e.g. the common cold) that have adapted to co-exist with their host and non-equilibrium viruses (e.g. HIV) that have recently jumped from another species, are not adapted to the new host, and which can lead to disastrous outcomes (e.g. loss of immune function with potential lethality in the case of HIV).

In part 2, I describe the growing health problem that is facing the world with the spread of HIV and the limitations of current drug therapies and vaccine strategies. We need new ideas for tackling this problem. Here and in the next segment, I describe bold strategies of using gene therapy to conquer HIV, The approach that I describe in this segment involves gene therapy to produce short hairpin RNAs (siRNA) that target the destruction of a critical co-receptor of HIV, which the viruses that needs to infect cells. I discuss initial proof-of-principle experiments that suggest this approach might be feasible and the next steps needed to develop this idea into a real therapy.

In this last segment, I describe another gene therapy strategy for HIV in which we propose to develop antibody-like proteins that can be expressed by a patient's B cells and will target the HIV virus for destruction. To achieve this objective, hematopoietic (blood) stem cells must to be targeted with the gene, which will ultimately develop into B cells that express the therapeutic molecule. The ultimate goal is to produce a life-long supply of anti-HIV neutralizing antibodies. In this lecture, I describe the molecular methods underlying this strategy and a development path from proof-of-principle studies in mouse to safe trials in humans. This project receives funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Harrison begins his talk by asking why most non-enveloped viruses and some enveloped viruses are symmetrical in shape.  He proceeds to show us lovely images of the structures obtained by x-ray crystallography of numerous viral coat proteins.  Deciphering these structures allowed scientists to understand that viral coat proteins form multimers, such as dimers and pentamers, which in turn interact with a scaffold that ensures that the coat proteins are correctly placed.  This arrangement results in symmetrically shaped viruses.

In Part 1, Harrison also explains that enveloped viruses infect cells by inducing the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes.  He delves deeper into the molecular mechanism of membrane fusion driven by the hemagglutinin or HA protein of the influenza virus in Part 2 of his talk.

Non-enveloped viruses, on the other hand, must enter cells by a mechanism other than membrane fusion. This is the focus of Part 3. Using rotavirus as a model, Harrison and his colleagues have used a combination of Xray crystallography and electron cryomicroscopy to decipher how the spike protein on the viral surface changes its conformation and perforates the cell membrane allowing the virus to enter the cell.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KoJWuWzVgqQ/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:08.747390
INXyBJ1aLUQ,iBiology,UCsvqEZBO-kNmwuDBbKbfL6A,1470756471.0,"Susan Lindquist (Whitehead, MIT / HHMI) 1a: Protein Folding in Infectious Disease and Cancer","http://www.ibiology.org/ibioseminars/protein-folding-infectious-disease-cancer.html

In Part 1a, Dr. Lindquist explains the problem of protein folding.  Proteins leave the ribosome as long, linear chains of amino acids but they need to fold into complex three dimensional shapes in the extremely crowded environment of the cytoplasm.  Since protein misfolding can be disastrous for cells, proteins known as heat shock proteins (HSPs) have evolved to facilitate proper protein folding. Lindquist explains that sometimes the heat shock response becomes unbalanced resulting in human disease. In the case of cancer, HSPs help cancer cells survive many stresses that would typically kill them.  In contrast, many neurodegenerative diseases are a result of protein misfolding and aggregation suggesting that, in these diseases, HSPs are not activated when they should be.  
Yeast have many of the same cellular processes as humans including a stress response to aid in protein folding and prevent protein aggregation. In Part 1b, Lindquist describes how genetic screens in yeast helped scientists identify mutations that increased the formation of aggregates similar to those found in neurodegenerative diseases.  Furthermore a screen in yeast of ~500,000 chemicals identified a number of compounds that prevented protein aggregation. Results from both experiments have since been validated in mice and human neuronal models. 
When cells undergo stress, the expression of HSPs increases. In Part 2, Lindquist explains that while most HSPs are expressed only as needed, Hsp90 is expressed in excess. This “buffer” of Hsp90 facilitates the folding of some mutant proteins (such as v-src) that would usually misfold and be degraded by the cell. Thus, Hsp90 potentiates the impact of these mutations.  Interestingly, the Hsp90 “buffer” can also act to hide or suppress the impact of other mutations. These “hidden” mutations are found when cells are stressed reducing the pool of available Hsp90.  Thus, Hsp90 provides a plausible mechanism for allowing genetic diversity and fluctuating environments to fuel the pace of evolutionary change. 
In her last talk, Lindquist focuses on prion proteins.  Prions are perhaps best known as the infectious agents in diseases such as mad cow disease.  However, Lindquist argues that there are many great things about prions too.  They provide a protein-based mechanism of inheritance that allows organisms to develop new traits, quickly and reversibly, and thereby adapt to new environments.  Working in yeast, Lindquist and her colleagues were able to identify numerous prion-like proteins that are induced at different levels, depending on the temperature, pH or presence of bacteria.  Expression of prions caused heritable, phenotypic changes in the yeast demonstrating that prions are another mechanism by which environmental changes can induce new traits that can be passed onto progeny.  As Lindquist says, perhaps it is time to give Lamarck back his dignity.

But the third domain of life wasn’t even discovered until the 1970s. This mysterious group of micro-organisms, the Archaea, remain one of the biggest puzzles in microbiology. They have been discovered in some of the most hostile environments on the planet, in conditions that would kill other forms of life. Even more strangely, we have yet to find a single species of Archaea that causes disease.

Dr Thorsten Allers from the University of Nottingham explores how these fascinating micro-organisms were first discovered – and how they have even made us reconsider our own place on the tree of life.

Dr. Jared Rutter shares new insights into the interplay between mitochondria, metabolism, and cellular behavior.

Mitochondria are integral to the metabolism of eukaryotic cells, yet many of their properties are not fully understood. In Part 1 of this iBioSeminar, Dr. Jared Rutter lays out the foundational knowledge of mitochondrial structure and origin, and shares what is currently known about mitochondrial roles in metabolism, protein homeostasis, and signaling. He ends by highlighting a focus of his research group: to unravel the functions of uncharacterized mitochondrial proteins.

In Part 2 of his talk, Rutter describes his group’s work to unravel the relationship between the activity of the Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier (MPC) and the behavior of numerous cell types, including cancer and stem cells. His group found that forced expression of the MPC in multiple stem cell models led to reduced “stemness” and proliferative capacity, and that MPC inhibition could promote organoid formation in culture and tumor formation in vivo. These data indicate an important link between mitochondria, metabolism, and cell behavior.

In his Part 3, Rutter emphasizes the challenge of mitochondrial protein synthesis. How do the components of the electron transport chain (ETC) assemble in the right stoichiometry at the right time? Rutter introduces the LYR family of proteins, which aid assembly of ETC components. LYR proteins interact with a common binding partner, the acyl carrier protein (ACP), via a unique fatty acyl moiety on ACP. Rutter’s group showed that ACP acylation is necessary for assembly of the ETC and activation of oxidative phosphorylation.

Talk Overview:
Animals, plants, green algae, fungi and slime molds are all forms of multicellular life, yet each evolved multicellularity independently. How did animals evolve from their single-celled ancestors? King addresses this question using a group of fascinating organisms called choanoflagellates.  Choanoflagellates are the closest living relatives to animals; they are single-cell, flagellated, bacteria eating organisms found between fungi and animals on the phylogenetic tree of life. By sequencing the genomes of many choanoflagellate species, King and her colleagues have discovered that some genes required for multicellularity in animals, such as adhesion, signaling, and extracellular matrix genes, are found in choanoflagellates.  This suggests that these genes may have evolved before the transition to multicellularity in animals.
The choanoflagellate S. rosetta can exist as a unicellular organism or it can switch to form multicellular colonies. In fact, its life cycle can be quite complex; it can form long chain colonies, spherical colonies called rosettes, or exist in different unicellular forms.  

In part 2 of her talk, King explains how she chose to use S. rosetta as a simple model for animal origins.  After overcoming the technical difficulty of getting S. rosetta to form rosettes in the lab, she investigated how rosettes develop and how the cells within a rosette adhere to each other.  She also asked the intriguing question “What regulates rosette development?”.  It turns out that rosette formation is regulated by lipids produced by environmental bacteria that S. rosetta eat.  This result adds to the growing interest in how bacteria may be influencing the behavior of diverse animals including humans.

Speaker Biography:
While fossils sparked Nicole King’s childhood interest in evolution, she realized that the fossil record doesn’t explain fully how animals first evolved from their single celled ancestors. To answer this question, King decided to study modern day choanoflagellates. Choanoflagellates are single celled organisms that can also develop in to multicellular assemblages.

King first learned about choanoflagellates while she was a graduate student with Richard Losick at Harvard University. She moved to the University of Wisconsin-Madison to do a post-doctoral fellowship focusing on choanoflagellates.  In 2003, King joined the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley.  Currently, she is a Professor of Molecular and Cell Biology at Berkeley and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator.

King’s innovative studies have been recognized with a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship and a Pew Scholarship.  King is also a Senior Fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1v6cgSkiHik/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:08.970914

Superficially, these microbes look similar to bacteria, but in fact, they form an entirely separate branch on the tree of life. 

The most famous archaea are the extremophiles, which can survive at extremes of temperature, salt and acidity. But scientists have been puzzled by something else: not a single species we know of causes disease.

TbGIGGBO7Eg,iBiology,UCsvqEZBO-kNmwuDBbKbfL6A,1501870907.0,Randy Schekman (HHMI & UCB) 2: Genes and proteins required for secretion,"https://www.ibiology.org/cell-biology/protein-secretion/#part-2

Part 1: The Secretory Pathway: How cells package and traffic proteins for export: Randy Schekman overviews the secretory pathway and reviews historical experiments that shaped our molecular understanding of this pathway.

Part 2: Genes and proteins required for secretion: Randy Schekman explains how his laboratory used baker’s yeast to uncover major proteins involved in the secretory pathway, and describes proteins involved in budding, vesicle trafficking, and vesicle fusion.

Part 3: How human cells secrete small RNAs in extracellular vesicles: Randy Schekman outlines exosome biogenesis.

Talk Overview: 
In his first lecture, Dr. Randy Schekman overviews the secretory pathway and reviews historical experiments that shaped our molecular understanding of this pathway. The journey begins at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where proteins that engage the secretory pathway get translated. The mRNA of these proteins codes for a signal sequence that serves as a “tag” to bring the mRNA-ribosome-newly-synthesized protein to the ER for continued translation and movement of the new secretory protein across the ER membrane into the interior or lumen of the organelle. Vesicles transport the recently translated proteins to the Golgi Apparatus, where they get “packaged” and sent to their final destination.

In his second lecture, Schekman explains how his laboratory used baker’s yeast to uncover major proteins involved in the secretory pathway, and describes proteins involved in budding, vesicle trafficking, and vesicle fusion.  Schekman also presents data from his laboratory that helped to identify the ER channel through which proteins enter the secretory pathway. These series of experiments show how, step by step, scientific knowledge evolves, uncovering the fundamental mechanisms to better understand human disease.

In his third lecture, Schekman outlines exosome biogenesis. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles released by the cell, and in contrast to intracellular vesicles, exosomes contain small molecules of RNA. Schekman’s laboratory characterized the RNAs contained in exosomes and showed the importance of Ybx1 protein for the recruitment of certain miRNAs into exosomes. 

Speaker Biography: 
Dr. Randy Schekman is a Professor in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, and an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He studied the enzymology of DNA replication as a graduate student with Arthur Kornberg at Stanford University. His current interest in cellular membranes developed during a postdoctoral period with S. J. Singer at the University of California, San Diego. At Berkeley, he developed a genetic and biochemical approach to the study of eukaryotic membrane traffic.

Among his awards are the Eli Lilly Award in microbiology and immunology, the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research and the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize. In 2013, Schekman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology jointly with Thomas Südhof and James Rothman for their contributions to understanding vesicle trafficking. Schekman is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. From 2006-2011, he was Editor-in-Chief of the Proceeding of the NAS. Currently, he is Editor-in-Chief of the open access journal eLife.

Why pay for that manufactured product? Instead, you can have a richer, more diverse culture when you harvest your own yeast from nature. Wild yeast is abundant, easy to cultivate, tasty, and healthy. It lends a terrific flavor to all your baked goods, and may even reduce food sensitivities in people who have trouble tolerating grains and wheat, since it's less refined, unprocessed and loaded with so many different varieties. You might have a friend with a wild yeast starter, in which case, ask for a scoop and begin feeding it! But if you want to start from scratch, Roe Sie, from the King's Roost, teaches you how to catch wild yeast in your own kitchen with a bit of flour and some water (or pineapple juice!) to start your own colony from scratch. It's easy and fun.

Budding is a type of asexual reproduction in which a daughter individual is formed from a small projection, the bud, arising on the parent body. 

In yeast, buds arise as small cytoplasmic outgrowths from the parent cell.  This is followed by the division of the nucleus. The nucleus of the parent cell divides into two and one of the daughter nuclei migrates into the bud.  The bud then enlarges and detaches from the parent cell by forming a constriction at the base.  The daughter cell matures into a new yeast cell. The daughter cell produced during the budding process is generally smaller than the mother cell. Unlike binary fission, in budding the parent cell remains intact.

Warburg effect in Cancer
The major metabolic shift
Reprogramming Energy Metabolism

in the presence of adequate ocygen ATP is generated by  Oxidative Phosphoryation
As Oxygen Decreases Shift from Oxidative phosphorylation  to Glycolysis- Anaerobic glycolysis PASTEUR EFFECT
Otto Heinrich Warburg , German Physiologist Observed that cancer cells had increased rates of glycolysis Despite the availability of adequate oxygen levels- WARBURG EFFECT
The puzzling questions
Is this  phenomenon Cancer specific?
No!
This is evident in rapidly growing normal tissues too  as in embryonic  tissue
It is a property of growing cells but got “stuck” in cancer cells!!

Why do cancer cells activate glycolysis despite the presence of oxygen?
Assures ATP synthesis when tumor outgrows its oxygen supply
 The metabolic intermediates of AEROBIC GLYCOLYSIS  provides raw material for the synthesis of cellular components in these rapidly dividing tumor cells! And also favor tumor growth
Release of acid lowers extracellular pH which favors tumor invasion and suppresses immune effectors

How  do they manage to activate glycolysis despite the presence of oxygen?
Induction of glycolytic enzymes BY overexpression of HIF 1
Induction of Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase
Down regulation of mitochondrial enzymes and decrease in the number of mitochondria
Mitochondrial defects due to mutations in mitochondrial DNA leading to  malfunction of oxidative phosphorylation


Significance of  understanding Warburg effect
Diagnostic 
This property of “glucose hunger” is used in PET scanning of solid tumors
18F-flourodeoxyglucose, a nonmetabolizable glucose derivative of glucose is used where this is preferentially taken by tumor cells/rapidly dividing cells

Therapeutic
Numerous Glycolytic inhibitors have been developed which can be potential anticancer drugs

Viewpoint!
 Warburg effect is a growth promoting metabolic alteration in cancer cells
One of the Hallmarks of Cancer!
 lots of explanations are given for this effect. 
However the exact cause and its value,.. As of now still remains elusive!",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LXaO59IqQm8/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:09.385188

Defects in DNA repair& Cancer

DNA damage is ubiquitous
DNA damage is not the same as mutation though it can lead to mutation
DNA damage is a chemical alteration ( can be corrected)
Mutation is a change in the sequence of  base pairs ( cannot be corrected )

If any kind of DNA damage is likely to lead to a mutation, we call it genotoxic
There are Mechanisms to repair the types of DNA damage
The Effective DNA repair  is the backbone of cancer free survival
Genome instability is an Important hallmark of cancer
 INSTABILITY:  could be point mutations, trinucleotide repeat expansions and contractions, gene duplications, deletions, and inversions, to large-scale chromosome changes including translocations and whole chromosome gains and losses.
DNA repair systems play critical roles in genome stabilization
Defects in DNA repair pathways contribute to specific instabilities
 Erroneous DNA repair leads to mutations or chromosomal aberrations 

The Genes for DNA  repair

Individuals with inherited defects in DNA repair genes are  at increased risk of developing cancer.
Base Excision Pathway (BER):MDB4,Colorectal Ovary Multiple myeloma

NER Pathway:XPC, Bladder Skin Cancer
Direct reversal of Damage:MGMT,Colon Gastric Glioblastoma
Mismatch excision repair (MMR):MSH 6Colorectal
Non Homologous End joining:  XRCC5, lung
Homologous recombination: BRCA 1,Breast Ovary Gastric

Pm35bSqlh6c,JJ Medicine,UCFPvnkCZbHfBvV8ApBBE0vA,1514584040.0,Notch Signaling Pathway | Purpose and Mechanism,"Lesson on the Notch Signaling Pathway. The Notch signaling pathway is a highly conserved and critically important pathway in homeostasis and the development of sensory hair cells and branched arterial networks. The Notch signaling pathway derives its name from the NOTCH receptors, which are activated through ligands located on the cell membrane of other cells (sending cells). The NOTCH receptor is composed of three domains, the extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a notch intracellular domain (NICD). Upon ligand binding to the Notch receptor, the Notch receptor undergoes cleavage reactions, releasing the NICD into the cytosol. The NICD binds to the complex of proteins, which translocate into the nucleus and activate Notch target genes involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.

Hey everyone! Here is a lesson on the Notch signaling pathway. In this lesson, you learn what the Notch signaling pathway is, why it is important in development and homeostasis, what ligands activate the Notch receptors and the Notch signaling pathway, and how the Notch pathway leads to the expression of Notch target genes.

Read our blog post for more information on cell line immortalization: https://info.abmgood.com/cell-immortalization

Timestamps for topics covered in this video:
[0:29] What are immortalized cells?
[1:19] How do you generate immortalized cells?
[3:47] Cell line quality control considerations

You’re probably used to using cells that are taken directly from living tissue, called primary cells. The difficulty with primary cells is that their telomeres shorten after every cell division, causing the cells to enter senescence and stop dividing after only a few cell cycles. This means that if you are working on a long term project, you’ll frequently need to keep harvesting and re-establishing new batches of primary cells. In addition, every batch of cells is different due to different harvesting conditions, making reproducibility a headache!

Immortalized cells (also called continuous cells or cell lines) are primary cells whose telomeres and/or tumour suppressor genes have been altered. Tumour suppressor genes (e.g. p53 and Rb) are important for signalling the cell to stop dividing when the likelihood of DNA damage is higher (i.e. after multiple cell cycles). In the case of immortalized cells, these genes have been knocked down or their function inhibited so that the cell is able to keep dividing indefinitely.

In this video, we will cover two major cell immortalization strategies: (1) Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase protein (TERT) expression, and (2) viral oncogenes. We will also introduce you to two immortalization methods (lentiviral transduction and plasmid transfection).

In his iBiology talk, Dr. Timothy Lu describes how biological circuits, using principles from engineering, can be used as digital (all or none) or analog (continuous spectrum) sensors, and can be programmed in a cell to ‘remember’ an input and pass this memory to the cell’s offspring after it divides. Dr. Lu gives several examples of biological circuits that his lab created that can allow a cell to sense the extracellular environment and give a readable output that can be maintained through subsequent cell divisions. In the future, these types of circuits can be developed as non-invasive diagnostics or therapeutics in humans. Dr. Lu ends his talk by discussing the open challenges facing this area of synthetic biology. 

Speaker Biography:

For synthetic biologists to engineer cells that can make complex chemicals or perform complex functions, they must be able to tell the cell which genes to turn on and at what time.  To do this they build genetic circuits composed of a series of gates that respond to a specific input with a specific output. Voigt’s lab has developed a library of gates that can be interconnected, will function robustly and will not interfere with each other.  In addition, they have developed software that lets users arrange the gates to form a circuit of their choice. The software provides DNA sequence encoding the circuit and the DNA can be synthesized and inserted into a cell. Voigt’s lab has successfully built and tested circuits in many cell types to make many products.  

Speaker Biography:
Chris Voigt obtained his Bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Michigan and his PhD in biochemistry and biophysics from the California Institute of Technology.  He was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley and his first faculty position was at the University of California, San Francisco.  In 2011, he joined the Department of Biological Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an associate professor.  His lab is developing a programming language for cells to allow the regulation of complex cellular functions and their application to problems in biotechnology.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lNttxYdGHs4/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:10.202831

Dr. Eric Chow gives an overview of single cell sequencing, explains why this approach is useful, and talks through the leading methods.

Single cell sequencing, as the name implies, allows researchers to examine the genomic information for individual cells. This provides an opportunity to examine cell-to-cell differences and identify cell subtypes, which provides insight into how specific cells function within and respond to their environment. Dr. Eric Chow begins his talk with an overview of single cell sequencing with a focus on RNA. He then goes on to outline the predominant approaches, including plate-based, microfluidic-based, and combinatorial indexing methods. He finishes by addressing approaches to single cell analysis that don’t rely on RNA, including methods that use DNA, proteins, and antibodies. He also reviews some of the benefits and limitations of analysis at the level of individual cells.

Part 1a: Mechanisms of Chromosomal DNA Replication: The Replication Fork: For an organism to survive, its DNA must be accurately and completely copied during each cell division. Bell explains how replication begins at the DNA replication fork.

Part 1b: Mechanisms of Chromosomal DNA Replication: Initiation of Replication: Bell describes how the multi-enzyme replisome identifies the correct site for the initiation of DNA replication and begins to copy the chromosomal DNA. 

Part 2: Single-Molecule Studies of Eukaryotic DNA Replication: Stephen Bell’s lab determined, at the level of single molecules,  the sequence of events which initiate eukaryotic DNA replication.

Talk Overview:
Every time a cell divides, its genomic DNA must be completely, accurately and rapidly duplicated. This feat is completed by an amazing, multi-enzyme nanomachine, called the replisome. The replisome includes one DNA helicase, one RNA polymerase and three DNA polymerases, as well as numerous non-enzymatic proteins, all of which work together at the DNA replication fork. In Part 1a, Dr. Bell gives an excellent, step-by-step description of the function of each replisome protein at the bacterial replication fork. 

In Part 1b, Bell focuses on the initiation of DNA replication. At the site where replication begins, chromosomal DNA is separated into two single strands.  Two replisomes are then assembled on the DNA and they move away from each other in opposite directions.  Bell describes how the sites for the initiation of replication are identified, how the helicase is loaded and activated, and how the replisome is assembled.  As he explains, these events are significantly more complicated in eukaryotes than bacteria. 

In his last talk, Dr. Bell describes an assay developed in his lab to study eukaryotic DNA replication at the single molecule level. Using this assay, Bell’s lab has determined the detailed process by which eukaryotic DNA helicase loads on DNA and begins the replication process. 

Speaker Biography:
Dr. Bell is Professor of Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.  His lab studies the assembly of multi-protein complexes called replisomes that are responsible for replicating eukaryotic chromosomal DNA, and the regulation of this process to ensure that each chromosome is accurately and completely replicated just once per cell cycle. 

In recognition of his contributions to the field, Bell was awarded the National Academy of Sciences Award in Molecular Biology and the ASBMB/Schering-Plough Scientific Achievement Award. Bell has also received the MIT Everett Moore Baker Memorial Teaching Award and the School of Science Teaching Prize for Excellence in Undergraduate Education.  Bell is co-author of the popular Molecular Biology of the Gene textbook.  

Bell received his BA in biochemistry from Northwestern University and his PhD in biochemistry from the University of California, Berkeley where he worked with Robert Tjian. He was a post-doctoral fellow with Bruce Stillman at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory before moving to MIT.

Talk Overview:
In her first talk, Green provides a detailed look at protein synthesis, or translation.  Translation is the process by which nucleotides, the “language” of DNA and RNA, are translated into amino acids, the “language” of proteins.  Green begins by describing the components needed for translation; mRNA, tRNA, ribosomes, and the initiation, elongation, and termination factors. She then explains the roles of these players in ensuring accuracy during the initiation, elongation, termination and recycling steps of the translation process.  By comparing translation in bacteria and eukaryotes, Green explains that it is possible to determine which components and steps are highly conserved and predate the divergence of different kingdoms on the tree of life, and which are more recent adaptations.
 Green’s second talk focuses on work from her lab investigating how ribosomes detect defective mRNAs and trigger events leading to the degradation of the bad RNA and the incompletely translated protein product and to the recycling of the ribosome components.  Working in yeast and using a number of biochemical and genetic techniques, Green’s lab showed that the protein Dom34 is critical for facilitating ribosome release from the short mRNAs that result from mRNA cleavage.  Experiments showed that Dom34-mediated rescue of ribosomes from short mRNAs is an essential process for cell survival in higher eukaryotes. 

Speaker Biography:
Rachel Green received her BS in chemistry from the University of Michigan. She then moved to Harvard to pursue her PhD in the lab of Jack Szostak where she worked on designing catalytic RNA molecules and investigating their implications for the evolution of life.  As a post-doctoral fellow at the University of California, Santa Cruz, Green began to study how the ribosome translates mRNA to protein with such accuracy.  

Currently, Green is a Professor of Molecular Biology and Genetics at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Research in her lab continues to focus on the ribosome and factors involved in the fidelity of eukaryotic and prokaryotic translation.

Green is the recipient of a Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Graduate Teaching Award as well as the recipient for numerous awards for her research. She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2012.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7EZ87bIvCOM/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:10.545170

KQI9yZX8HzM,iBiology,UCsvqEZBO-kNmwuDBbKbfL6A,1584129842.0,Michael Dickinson (CalTech) 1: How Flies Fly: Lift,"https://www.ibiology.org/biophysics/how-flies-fly

Have you ever tried to catch a flying fly only to be frustrated by their ability to evade your efforts? Then you know that many insects are extremely agile fliers.  In his three talks, Dr. Michael Dickinson uses aerodynamics, muscle physiology and neuroscience to explain how flies fly. 

In Part 1, Dickinson focuses on lift. How do insects generate the aerodynamic forces necessary to stay in the air?  Dickinson explains that by studying high speed videos of flies in flight, it is possible to determine the motion of the wing at each moment in time and, from that information, determine the forces that the insect is generating during an entire wing stroke.  Early studies of this type calculated that insects did not generate enough force to keep them in the air! So how do flies fly? To answer this question, Dickinson and colleagues built a large scale robotic model of an insect wing moving through a viscous solution.  Video tape of these models showed that the wing can form a large vortex at its leading edge. This vortex augments the forces generated by the insect and provides enough lift to keep the insect in flight.  By changing the angle of attack of the wing, the fly can change the size of the leading edge vortex and how much lift is produced. 

Dickinson’s second talk focuses on power.  Small insect wings must beat very rapidly- much more quickly than can be controlled by the release and uptake of Ca2+ that typically regulates muscle contraction.  Instead flies use two sets of stretch activated power muscles.  The contraction of downstroke muscles stretches and stimulates upstroke muscles, and vice versa, allowing the insect to beat its wings very quickly.  In addition to power muscles, insects have tiny steering muscles that connect directly to the wing and regulate wing deviation during the wing stroke. With a combination of high speed video and electrical recording, Dickinson demonstrates how these tiny muscles can change wing position and allow a fly to undergo its amazing aerial acrobatics. 

In Part 3, Dickinson discusses how insects control flight. Insects have many sensors on their bodies and wings that detect odors, the polarization of light, body rotation, air movement, and more. All of this sensory information is taken in and integrated by the insect’s brain. The brain then regulates muscle function to perform the behaviors needed for the fly to survive in its natural environment.  Dickinson and his colleagues have built “arenas” in which a fly can be tethered and visual cues can be used to make the fly think it is flying in a specific direction with a certain speed, or being attacked by a predator.  Using high speed video, it is possible to measure the flies response to these visual cues.  Amazingly, within 20 milliseconds of detecting a predator, a fly can integrate its response so that it completely changes flight direction and flies away from the perceived predator.   

Speaker Biography:
Dr. Michael Dickinson’s lab studies the flight behavior of insects. Lab members combine their interests in cellular physiology, biomechanics, aerodynamics and neuroscience to build an integrated model of insect flight.
 
Dickinson studied neuroscience as an undergraduate at Brown University and he developed an interest in insect flight while he was a PhD student in zoology at the University of Washington.  Following a short post-doc at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Dickinson joined the faculty at the University of Chicago in 1991. In 1996, he moved to the University of California, Berkeley, and he moved to his current position as the Esther and Abe M Zarem Professor of Bioengineering and Aeronautics at the California Institute of Technology in 2002. Dickinson co-directed the Neural Systems & Behavior summer course at the Marine Biological Lab in Woods Hole, MA from 2005 to 2007 and he continues to be involved in teaching in the course.  He is also a monitoring editor at the Journal of Experimental Biology. 
 
Dickinson’s pioneering research has been recognized by a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 2001 and election to the American Academy of Arts and Science in 2008.

Dr. Hans Clevers provides a historical perspective on the discovery of adult stem cells in the gut, and explains how his lab developed a technique to grow from a single stem cell an organoid or mini-organ, a structure that recapitulates the normal structure of the gut.

In his first talk, Dr. Hans Clevers provides a historical perspective on the discovery of adult stem cells in the gut. They identified a Wnt-dependent, rapid proliferating population of cells at the bottom of the crypt which seemed to be important for generating all epithelial cells in crypts and villi, and they hypothesized that these were gut stem cells. By using the Lgr5 gene as a marker, the Clevers’ lab confirmed that these long-lived cells were indeed the gut stem cells by showing that they were able to generate all of the cell types of the gut epithelium throughout life. Clevers characterizes the gut stem cells and its progenitors, and explains how his lab developed a technique to grow from a single stem cell an organoid or mini-organ, a structure that recapitulates the normal structure of the gut.

In his second talk, Clevers shows how one can apply what we have learned from developing gut organoids to generate mini-organs for other epithelial tissues, like liver and lung. Clevers shows that these organoids have a similar expression profile as well as structural characteristics to those observed in real tissue. In addition, he shows how this technique can be used to generate non-mammalian organoids, like the development of venom gland organoids from snake venom gland tissue. As Clevers explains, such organoids can be used to discover possible novel therapeutics, including new anti-venom serum.  

In his third talk, Clevers describes how organoids can guide our understanding of disease progression in cancer. In addition, using Cystic Fibrosis and cancer as examples, Clevers shows how organoids can be used to predict therapeutic outcome in patients.

Speaker Biography:
Dr. Hans Clevers is a Principal Investigator at the Hubrecht Institute, a Professor in Molecular Genetics at the University Medical Center Utrecht, and an Oncode Investigator. He obtained his medical (1984) and doctoral (1985) degrees at the University of Utrecht. He continued his education as a post-doctoral fellow in the lab of Dr. Cox Terhorst at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute at Harvard Medical School. In 1989, he joined the faculty at the University of Utrecht, where his lab studies the biology of Wnt signaling in development and cancer. Using Lgr5 as a marker, his lab discovered adult stem cells in the intestine, and developed a technique to grow these stem cells into epithelial organoids. Using these organoids, his lab is able to study a multitude of physiological, and pathological processes, and use organoids as a model to understand disease progression and predict drug responses.

For his scientific contributions, Clevers received the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences in 2013, and is an elected member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) (1999), the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences (2000), the National Academy of Sciences (2014), the French Academie des Sciences (2017) and the Royal Society of London (2019).

Szostak begins his lecture with examples of the extreme environments in which life exists on Earth.  He postulates that given the large number of earth-like planets orbiting sun-like stars, and the ability of microbial life to exist in a wide range of environments, it is probable that an environment that could support life exists somewhere in our galaxy.  However, whether or not life does exist elsewhere, depends on the answer to the question of how difficult it is for life to arise from the chemistry of the early planets.  Szostak proceeds to demonstrate that by starting with simple molecules and conditions found on the early earth, it may in fact be possible to generate a primitive, self-replicating protocell.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PqPGOhXoprU/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:10.990435

The X chromosome is many time larger than the Y chromosome. To compensate for this genetic inequality, female mammalian cells undergo X chromosome inactivation of one X chromosome. Dr. Jeannie Lee explains the how and why of X chromosome inactivation.

Talk Overview:
In mammals, sex is determined by a pair of unequal sex chromosomes.  Genetically male mammals have an X and a Y chromosome while genetically female mammals have two X chromosomes.  The X chromosome is many times larger than the Y chromosome. To compensate for this genetic inequality, female mammals undergo X chromosome inactivation in which one of the X chromosomes is randomly chosen to be silenced. X chromosome inactivation has been studied for over 50 years both because it is a physiologically important event and because it is an excellent model for studying epigenetic silencing of genes by long non-coding RNAs. In her first talk, Dr. Jeannie Lee gives an overview of the steps a cell must go through during X inactivation. These include “counting” the X chromosomes, deciding which X chromosome to inactivate, initiating the inactivation and spreading it across the chromosome, and finally maintaining inactivation of the same X chromosome for the rest of the life of the organism.  

In her second talk, Lee elaborates on the early steps of X inactivation. Very early in development, cells “count” the number of X chromosomes and decide if one needs to be inactivated, and if so which one.  There is a region of the X chromosome called the X inactivation center which is enriched in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).  Lee explains how she and others showed that by sensing the ratio of two specific lncRNAs the cell can determine how many X chromosomes are present.  Further studies showed that two different lncRNAs are responsible for randomly determining which X chromosome will be inactivated. Finally, she discusses the hypothesis that the allelic choice mechanism depends on a transient chromosomal pairing event that occurs at the beginning of the dosage compensation process.

And in her last talk, Lee describes how X inactivation is nucleated and spreads across the X chromosome.  The Xist lncRNA is known to be necessary and sufficient for X inactivation.  Lee describes experiments that identified the factors that tether Xist to the X chromosome and showed how Xist spreads to cover the entire X chromosome. She then goes on to explain that Xist blocks transcription in three ways: 1) Xist recruits factors that repress transcription via epigenetic modification such as histone methylation 2) Xist repels factors that open chromatin preparing it for transcription and 3) Xist changes the 3 dimensional organization of chromosomes. Lee ends with a model of our current understanding of the complex but critical process of X chromosome inactivation.  

Speaker Biography:
Dr. Jeannie Lee is a Professor in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and in the Department of Molecular Biology at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Her lab uses X chromosome inactivation as a model to study epigenetic regulation by long noncoding RNAs.

Lee received her AB in biochemistry and molecular biology from Harvard University and her MD/PhD from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.  She was a postdoctoral fellow at the Whitehead Institute and a resident at MGH before joining Harvard/MGH as a faculty member in 1997.  Lee was also an HHMI Investigator from 2001-2018. She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  Lee has been honored with numerous awards including the 2016 Centennial Prize from the Genetics Society of America, the 2016 Lurie Prize from the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, and the 2010 Molecular Biology Award from the National Academy of Sciences.  In 2018, she was President of the Genetics Society of America.

mHak9EZjySs,WEHImovies,UCdBrXvlJn60zgpIQcZ0Fe7w,1327440443.0,X Inactivation and Epigenetics,"X inactivation is a vital process that occurs in all DNA-containing cells of the female body. It is also an important research model and tool for studying epigenetics.  Epigenetics refers to processes that tell our cells how, and when, to read the DNA blueprint. The epigenetic regulation of DNA is critical in both normal development and disease.

X inactivation is a type of gene dosage compensation.

In humans, the sex chromosomes X and Y determine the sex of an individual - females have two X chromosomes (XX), males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). All of the genes on the Y chromosome are required in male development, while the genes on the X chromosome are needed for both male and female development. 

Because females receive two X chromosomes, they inherit two copies of many of the genes that are needed for normal function. Extra copies of genes or chromosomes can affect normal development. An example is Down's syndrome, which is caused by an extra copy of part or all of chromosome 21.

In female mammals, a process called X inactivation has evolved to compensate for the extra X chromosome. In X inactivation, each cell 'switches off' one of its X chromosomes, chosen at random, to ensure the correct number of genes are expressed, and to prevent abnormal development.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mHak9EZjySs/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:11.300758

Thanks to LastPass for sponsoring this video. Click here to start using LastPass: https://ve42.co/VeLP

What causes aging? According to Professor David Sinclair, it is a loss of information in our epigenome, the system of proteins like histones and chemical markers like methylation that turn on and off genes. Epigenetics allow different cell types to perform their specific functions - they are what differentiate a brain cell from a skin cell. Our DNA is constantly getting broken, by cosmic rays, UV radiation, free radicals, x-rays and regular cell division etc. When our cells repair that damage, the epigenome is not perfectly reset. And hence over time, noise accumulates in our epigenome. Our cells no longer perform their functions well. 

To counter this decline, we can activate the body's own defenses against aging by stressing the body. Eat less, eat less protein, engage in intense exercise, experience uncomfortable cold. When the body senses existential threats it triggers longevity genes, which attempt to maintain the body to ensure its survival until good times return. This may be the evolutionary legacy of early bacteria, which established these two modes of living (repair and protect vs grow and reproduce). Scientists are uncovering ways to mimic stresses on the body without the discomfort of fasting. Molecules like NMN also trigger sirtuins to monitor and repair the epigenome. This may slow aging.

Reversing aging requires an epigenetic reset, which may be possible using Yamanaka factors. These four factors can revert an adult cell into a pluripotent stem cell. Prof. Sinclair used three of the four factors to reverse aging in the retinal cells of old mice. He found they could see again after the treatment.

Lecture Overview: 
Circadian rhythms are an adaptation to the 24 hr day that we experience. Takahashi begins his talk with an historic overview of how the genes controlling circadian clocks were first identified in Drosophila and the cloning tour de force that was required to identify clock genes in mice. He also describes the experiments that resulted in the realization that all cells in the body have a circadian clock, not just cells in the brain.  
In part 1B, Takahashi explains that the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the brain generates a circadian rhythm of fluctuating body temperature that, in turn, signals to peripheral tissues. Heat shock factor 1 is one of the signaling molecules responsible for communicating the temperature information and resetting peripheral clocks. 
In Part 2, Takahashi describes how crossing many mice of different genetic backgrounds allowed his lab to identify several genes that impact the output of the clock gene system through different mechanisms.
Takahashi begins the last part of his presentation with the crystal structures of BMAL and Clock, the two central activators of clock gene transcription. He goes on to describe how his lab showed that BMAL/Clock controls the DNA binding activity of transcriptional regulators of not only cycling genes, but also of basic cell functions such as RNA polymerase 2 occupancy and histone modification.

All organisms have evolved ways to store energy- mostly as fat packaged into lipid droplets.  Farese and Walther explain how lipid droplets form in cells and the physiological importance of getting this process right. 

All life requires metabolic energy but energy supplies and demands change over time. For this reason, organisms have developed ways to store energy, predominantly as fat. Neutral lipids are packaged into lipid droplets, small organelles found in most eukaryotic cells and in some prokaryotes. Lipid droplets play a critical role in an organism’s physiology; too many lipid droplets can result in obesity and too few in metabolic disease.  In their first video, Drs. Farese and Walther introduce us to lipid droplets and explain their importance in cellular biology. 

In Part 2, Walther and Farese explain in more depth how lipid droplets form in cells in an organized manner.  Triglycerides and other neutral lipids are made in the ER membrane.  They accumulate in localized regions of the membrane that grow towards the cytosol and eventually bud off into lipid droplets.  Farese and Walther describe experiments from their lab and others that have identified a protein complex in the ER membrane called LDAF1/Seipin that regulates where triglycerides localize and grow into mature lipid droplets. 

In their final talk, Walther and Farese explain how proteins are targeted specifically to the surface of lipid droplets.  This has functional consequences since proteins at the surface of lipid droplets govern lipid droplet growth and hydrolysis, and some of these proteins are associated with diseases. Farese and Walther end their talk by describing a number of diseases or physiological conditions that are now recognized as resulting from mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in lipid droplet formation.

Speaker Biographies: 
Since 2014, Drs. Robert Farese and Tobias Walther have run a joint research lab in the TH Chan School of Public Health (HSPH) and Harvard Medical School at Harvard University. Their lab studies the mechanisms and physiology of lipid synthesis and storage in lipid droplets; organelles that are vital for storing energy and membrane building materials for the cell.  

Robert Farese Jr.:
Farese is currently Chair and Professor of Molecular Metabolism at HSPH, Professor of Cell Biology at Harvard Medical School, and an Associate Member of the Broad Institute.  As an undergraduate student at the University of Florida, Farese studied chemistry. He went on to do an MD degree at Vanderbilt University. He completed his residency training at the University of Colorado and then moved to the University of California, San Francisco to train in endocrinology and metabolism.  From 1994-2014, Farese was an investigator at the Gladstone Institutes at UCSF. In 2005, he took a sabbatical in the lab of Peter Walter at UCSF. There he met Tobi Walther, who was a post-doc at the time, and they began their long-running collaboration to study lipid droplets.  

Farese has received numerous awards and honors for his pioneering research. He is an elected member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation and the Association of American Physicians and he has received the Bristol-Myers Squibb Freedom to Discover Award and the ASBMB Avanti Award in Lipids. 

Tobias Walther:
Walther was a PhD student at the European Molecular Biology Lab (EMBL) where he studied the nuclear pore.  He then moved to Peter Walter’s lab at the University of California, San Francisco for post-doctoral studies.

Bishop begins his lecture with a historical review of the experiments that resulted in the realization that cancer has a genetic basis. He explains that mutations can cause normal cellular genes known as proto-oncogenes to become oncogenes, analogous to jammed accelerators causing uncontrolled cell division. Alternatively, mutations in tumor suppressor genes are analogous to a failed brake system. An accumulation of both types of mutation leads to the development of cancer.

In part 2 of his lecture, Bishop describes how the sequencing of cancer genomes will advance the study and management of cancer on various fronts, including the discovery of causes, the improvement of early detection, the prediction of outcome and the development of new therapeutics. He stresses the promise of designing therapeutics that can be targeted to those patients most likely to benefit from these drugs.

Bishop expands on this theme in part 3 where he describes experiments to find drugs that exploit vulnerabilities created by cancer genes, utilizing a genetic strategy known as ""synthetic lethality.""",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bLt-JL83OLc/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:11.471960

But how do cells know when to divide and when not to divide? We can't have cells just growing willy-nilly! That's what cancer is, and that's bad. Luckily, cells obey something called the cell cycle, which is regulated by a variety of signaling molecules, which tell the cell when to divide and when to chill out. Let's look at the phases of this cycle and some of its regulatory mechanisms now.

KtOnBUMuZiY,iBiology,UCsvqEZBO-kNmwuDBbKbfL6A,1460658606.0,C. David Allis (Rockefeller U.) 2:  Epigenetics in Development and Disease,"https://www.ibiology.org/genetics-and-gene-regulation/epigenetics/#part-2

In the first of his videos, Dr. Allis introduces the concept of epigenetics; a change in a cellular phenotype that is not due to DNA mutation but due to chemical modifications of proteins that result in changes in gene activation.  In the nucleus, DNA is wrapped around proteins called histones to form chromatin. How tightly the chromatin is packaged determines whether genes are active or not.  This switch between the “on and off” state of chromatin is regulated by chemical modification of histones.  Allis describes work from his lab and others that identified the enzymes that add, remove and recognize the histone modifications.  Changes in histone modification can cause a number of diseases including cancer. A key difference between genetic mutations and epigenetic modifications is that epigenetic changes are reversible making them an attractive drug target.

Dr. Allis focuses on the role of epigenetics in development and disease in his second talk.  Histones can be modified on a number of amino acids, particularly lysines, by the addition of acetyl or methyl groups.  Combinatorial patterns of these modifications act to enhance or repress gene expression. Allis describes work from his lab and others, which demonstrates that mutations in histone (for instance a lysine to methionine mutation) may block these modifications and, thus, impact gene expression.  Sadly, these “onco-histone” mutations have been identified as the cause of many diseases including pediatric brain tumors and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. 

Speaker Biography:
C. David Allis is the Joy and Jack Fishman Professor and Head of the Laboratory of Chromatin Biology and Epigenetics at The Rockefeller University.  Allis’ lab studies how modifications to histones, the proteins that package DNA, influence gene expression and the implications these changes have for human disease.  

Allis has been honored with many awards for his pioneering research including the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, the 2014 Japan Prize, the 2007 Canada Gairdner International Award and many others. Allis is a member of the National Academy of Sciences USA, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the French Academy of Sciences. 

Allis received his BS in biology from the University of Cincinnati and his PhD in biology from Indiana University and he was a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Rochester.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KtOnBUMuZiY/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:11.713125

Moshe Szyf is one of the poineers in the field of epigenetics. Szyf’ lab has proposed three decades ago that DNA methylation is a prime therapeutic target in cancer and other diseases and has postulated and provided the first set of evidence that the “social environment” early in life can alter DNA methylation launching the emerging field of “social epigenetics”. The Szyf’ lab is interested in understanding basic epigenetic mechanisms and their broad implications in human behavior, health and disease as well as in developing epigenetics’ based therapeutics and diagnostics.

lss9V79zn5Q,iBiology,UCsvqEZBO-kNmwuDBbKbfL6A,1575663387.0,"Emery Brown (Harvard Med., MIT) 1: Unconsciousness Under General Anesthetic is a Dynamic State","https://www.ibiology.org/neuroscience/anesthesia-brain

What happens to your brain under general anesthesia? EEG recordings can measure brain dynamics of patients under general anesthesia and may inform the development of safer and more specific anesthetics. 

Dr. Emery Brown explains that under general anesthesia your brain is not turned off but is very dynamic. Electrical oscillations in the brain can be recorded using an electroencephalogram (EEG).  Brown shows how oscillations induced by anesthesia interfere with normal communication between different regions of the brain.  By following oscillations of different frequencies, it is possible to monitor and adjust a patient’s level of unconsciousness under anesthesia.

All general anesthetics act in the brain stem region to induce slow brain oscillations. Brown shares EEG spectrograms that clearly show that the brain response to anesthesia varies with age. Younger brains show strong oscillations while those of older brains show weaker oscillations.  Interestingly, not all brains “age” at the same rate. By using EEG spectrogram to visualize brain dynamics, anesthesiologists can optimize drug dosage for individual patients.  Brown closes his talk by presenting recent research suggesting that it may be possible to “turn the brain back on” after general anesthesia as a way to speed patient recovery. 

Speaker Biography:
Dr. Emery Brown is an expert in understanding the neurophysiological basis for how general anesthesia works and passionate about his desire to pass this understanding on to others.  Recent technological advances allow large amounts of data to be recorded from the brain.  Brown’s lab is developing statistical tools and algorithms to analyze and interpret this data with the goal of more effectively monitoring the depth of brain anesthesia and developing safer and more specific anesthetic drugs.  

Brown is the Warren M. Zapol Professor of Anesthesia at Harvard Medical School and a practicing anesthesiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. He is also Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Medical Engineering and of Computational Neuroscience at MIT and an Investigator of the Picower Center for Learning and Memory at MIT.  Brown received his BA in mathematics, his PhD in statistics, and his MD, all from Harvard University. 

Brown has received numerous honors and awards over the course of his career.  He is one of only a handful of scientists to be elected to all three branches of the National Academies:  Science, Engineering and Medicine. Recently, his pioneering research was recognized with the Dickson Prize for Science in 2018.

Part 1: The Secretory Pathway: How cells package and traffic proteins for export: Randy Schekman overviews the secretory pathway and reviews historical experiments that shaped our molecular understanding of this pathway.

Part 2: Genes and proteins required for secretion: Randy Schekman explains how his laboratory used baker’s yeast to uncover major proteins involved in the secretory pathway, and describes proteins involved in budding, vesicle trafficking, and vesicle fusion.

Part 3: How human cells secrete small RNAs in extracellular vesicles: Randy Schekman outlines exosome biogenesis.


Talk Overview: 
In his first lecture, Dr. Randy Schekman overviews the secretory pathway and reviews historical experiments that shaped our molecular understanding of this pathway. The journey begins at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where proteins that engage the secretory pathway get translated. The mRNA of these proteins codes for a signal sequence that serves as a “tag” to bring the mRNA-ribosome-newly-synthesized protein to the ER for continued translation and movement of the new secretory protein across the ER membrane into the interior or lumen of the organelle. Vesicles transport the recently translated proteins to the Golgi Apparatus, where they get “packaged” and sent to their final destination.

In his second lecture, Schekman explains how his laboratory used baker’s yeast to uncover major proteins involved in the secretory pathway, and describes proteins involved in budding, vesicle trafficking, and vesicle fusion.  Schekman also presents data from his laboratory that helped to identify the ER channel through which proteins enter the secretory pathway. These series of experiments show how, step by step, scientific knowledge evolves, uncovering the fundamental mechanisms to better understand human disease.

In his third lecture, Schekman outlines exosome biogenesis. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles released by the cell, and in contrast to intracellular vesicles, exosomes contain small molecules of RNA. Schekman’s laboratory characterized the RNAs contained in exosomes and showed the importance of Ybx1 protein for the recruitment of certain miRNAs into exosomes. 

Speaker Biography: 
Dr. Randy Schekman is a Professor in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, and an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

EnIerDljc7g,iBiology,UCsvqEZBO-kNmwuDBbKbfL6A,1541530564.0,"David Sabatini (Whitehead, MIT, HHMI) 1: Introduction to mTOR and the Regulation of Growth","https://www.ibiology.org/cell-biology/mtor-regulation

David Sabatini outlines the critical role of mTOR in the regulation of growth. mTOR senses nutrient levels, growth factors and other signals and integrates a response to regulate cell growth.

Growth can be defined as the increase in the size of a cell or organism, due to a gain in mass caused by nutrient uptake and assimilation. Surprisingly, how growth is regulated was not well understood until quite recently. In his first talk, David Sabatini describes how insight into this question came from an unusual direction. The small molecule drug rapamycin was known to have anti-growth effects, but its intracellular target was not known.  Sabatini explains how he purified and cloned the target of rapamycin from rat brain and showed that it was a protein kinase. This protein was named mTOR in mammals and was shown to be homologous to the TOR proteins in yeast. Sabatini and others went on to show that mTOR is at the heart of two large protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, that sense upstream signals such as nutrient levels, hormones, and growth factors and direct downstream effectors to build or breakdown resources as needed for cell growth and proliferation. 

In his second talk, Sabatini explains that mTORC1 responds to many different upstream signals including a variety of growth factors, nutrients, and types of stress.  How does mTORC1 sense all these different signals and integrate them to produce a response that regulates cell growth? Sabatini’s lab found that the first step in sensing nutrients such as amino acids is the movement of mTORC1 from a diffuse localization in the cytosol to the lysosomal surface. The lab then spent many years identifying the large number of proteins that regulate the movement of mTORC1 to the lysosome and allow it to sense nutrients and modulate the downstream processes that control cell growth. In particular, the lab identified several proteins that serve as direct sensors of metabolites or amino acids like leucine and arginine. Interestingly, mutations in several of the proteins in the nutrient sensing pathway upstream of mTORC1 are now known to cause human disease, including epilepsy. This suggests that modulation of mTOR, by inhibitors such as rapamycin, might provide a treatment for these conditions.  

In his final talk, Sabatini focuses on a lysosomal membrane protein that his lab had found to interact with mTORC1 and to sense arginine levels inside the lysosome. In some cell types, the amino acids needed to build new proteins are not taken up as free amino acids but instead come from the breakdown of proteins in the lysosome. This led the lab to ask which arginine-rich proteins are being degraded in the lysosome, which led to the realization that ribosomal proteins are amongst the most arginine-rich proteins in mammalian cells. After many more experiments, they showed that mTORC1 regulates a balance between the biogenesis of ribosomes, and the breakdown of ribosomes (known as ribophagy), dependent on the nutritional state of the cell. Ribophagy seems to be particularly important for supplying the cell with nucleosides during nutrient starvation.

Speaker Biography:
Dr. David M. Sabatini is a member of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, a professor of Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Biology (MIT), an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, a senior member of the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT and a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT. His lab is interested in the regulation of growth and metabolism in mammals, with a focus on the critical mTOR pathway.  Research from Sabatini’s lab has led to a better understanding of the role of the mTOR pathway in diseases such as cancer and diabetes, as well as in aging. 
 
Sabatini received his undergraduate degree in biology from Brown University. As a MD/PhD student at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, he did his first experiments on rapamycin and mTOR in the lab of Solomon H. Snyder. After completing his MD/PhD in 1997, Sabatini started his own lab as a Whitehead fellow at the Whitehead Institute.  In 2002, he became a member of the Whitehead Institute and a faculty member at MIT.

Sabatini’s groundbreaking work has been recognized with numerous awards and honors including the National Academy of Science Award in Molecular Biology (2014), the Dickson Prize in Medicine (2017), the Lurie Prize in Biomedical Sciences (2017), and the Switzer Prize (2018). Sabatini was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2016.

Beth Stevens talks about her work on microglia cells in the brain and the role they play in brain development and neurodegenerative disease.

Microglia are the primary immune cells in the central nervous system. In the brain, they play central roles in proper development and function, as well as dysfunction and disease. In her first talk, Dr. Beth Stevens provides an overview of the many ways microglia cells operate, and how they can both harm and protect the brain. Fairly recent advances in the study of microglia through imaging have allowed researchers to identify different microglia states and study their dynamic roles at different stages of development. 

In her second second talk, Dr. Stevens dives deeper into the mechanisms that allow microglia to shape the network of connections between neurons in the brain. She provides an introduction to the role of microglia in synaptic pruning, the process of eliminating extra synapses in healthy developing brains. She then goes on to explain how the reactivation of this process affects aging and diseased brains.

In Part 1 of her talk, Dr. Theriot explains how tiny, nanometer sized actin molecules can self-assemble into filaments that are hundreds of microns in length.  These actin filaments are constantly growing and shrinking and this dynamic behavior allows a network of actin to generate enough force to move a cell forward. The intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes uses actin polymerization to propel itself through the cytoplasm and to invade other cells.  Many years of studies using Listeria have allowed Theriot and others to dissect the regulation of actin network growth in Listeria “comet tails” and at the leading edge of crawling cells. 

In her second lecture, Theriot explains that fish keratocytes are an excellent system to study rapid cell motility. By labeling actin and myosin in keratocytes, Theriot and her colleagues were able to follow turnover of actin in the lamellipodium.  Unexpectedly, they found that myosin II plays in important role in actin disassembly at the rear of the cell and asymmetric localization of myosin at the back of the cell appears to govern cell turning. Similar mechanisms of actin and myosin cooperation seem to drive rapid movement in both fish keratinocytes and human neutrophils. 

It has been known since the early 1990s that bacteria have homologues of both actin and tubulin. In general, however, bacteria are much simpler than eukaryotes.  In her final lecture, Theriot speculates about the factors that have evolved to allow eukaryotes to modify their cytoskeletons and build bigger, morphologically complex, multicellular organisms.  

Speaker Biography:
Julie Theriot attended college at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, graduating with degrees in Physics and Biology. She pursued graduate training at the University of California, San Francisco, earning her Ph.D. in Cell Biology in 1993.

Part 1: Frogs, Clams, Yeast & Human Cancer: Historical Perspective on Cell Cycle Regulation: Helen Piwnica-Worms provides a historical perspective on cell cycle regulation and outlines important experiments that revealed crucial mediators of the cell cycle.

Part 2: Translating Fundamental Cell Cycle Principles to Targeted Cancer Therapies: Helen Piwnica-Worms explains how scientists have used their understanding of the cell cycle regulation to generate targeted cancer therapies. 

Talk Overview:
In her first talk, Dr. Helen Piwnica-Worms provides a historical perspective on cell cycle regulation and outlines important experiments in frogs, clams, and yeast that revealed crucial mediators of the cell cycle. Scientists observed that there were factors that allowed cell cycle progression, while there were other factors that prevented the cell from going backward. Using these model organisms, scientists were able to characterize the activation of the inducer of mitosis, the M-Phase promoting factor, which is a heterodimer between cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdc2/Cdk1) and cyclin B.   

In her second talk, Piwnica-Worms explains how scientists have used their understanding of the cell cycle regulation to generate targeted cancer therapies. The cell has proteins that serve as cell cycle checkpoints, which allows the cell to respond appropriately to DNA damage. Although not all of the checkpoints are functional in a cancer cell, these cells still need the checkpoint proteins to respond to DNA damage. Piwnica-Worms’ laboratory studies the use of combining DNA damage agents with checkpoint inhibitors to selectively kill cancer cells. Her laboratory developed a patient-derived xenograft mouse model to study Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), and predict how the genotype of the tumor affects treatment.

Speaker Biography:
Dr. Helen Piwnica-Worms is professor of experimental radiation oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. She completed her bachelor’s degree in Biology at St. Olaf College in 1979, a doctoral degree in microbiology and immunology at Duke University Medical School in 1984, and a postdoctoral fellowship in pathology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in 1988. In 1989, Piwnica-Worms joined the faculty of Tufts University Medical School, and in 1992 she moved to the Microbiology and Molecular Genetics department at Harvard Medical School. In 1994, she joined the faculty at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, where she was the chair of Cell Biology and Physiology. Since 2013, Piwnica-Worms assumed the role of Vice Provost of Science and Professor of Experimental Radiation Oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.
 
As a basic research scientist, she was interested in understanding how the cell cycle was regulated. She showed how basic research discoveries allow for a better understanding of molecular underpinnings that opens new strategies to treat diseases, like cancer. Using immunocompromised mice, her laboratory developed a mouse model to perform preclinical studies using breast cancer cells from patients. For her scientific contributions, she was an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute from 1994 to 2011 and was elected as a member of the National Academy of Medicine in 2013.

obFukzaCocs,iBiology,UCsvqEZBO-kNmwuDBbKbfL6A,1529522261.0,"Elaine Fuchs (Rockefeller, HHMI) 3: Cancer: Hijacking the Wound Repair Mechanisms Used by Stem Cells","https://www.ibiology.org/development-and-stem-cells/skin-stem-cells/#part-3

Skin stem cells have great potential for the treatment of burns and corneal injuries. As Elaine Fuchs explains, understanding skin stem cell biology is also key to understanding cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma. 

Talk Overview:
Dr. Fuchs begins her talk with a brief history of stem cells including the discovery in the 1970s that adult skin stem cells could be cultured in vitro indefinitely.  This early work provided the foundation for later advances in embryonic stem cell (ESC) culture. ESCs are special because they can generate all the different tissues of the body, thus providing great potential for use in regenerative medicine. The use of ESCs is controversial, however, so scientists have developed ways of generating pluripotent stem cells that do not use embryonic tissue.  Fuchs reviews methods such as nuclear transfer and the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by reprogramming adult somatic cells. Cells generated by these methods may be used for drug and therapy screening and they may provide treatments for human diseases such as macular degeneration, Parkinson’s and other degenerative diseases. 

In her second talk, Fuchs focuses primarily on studies of adult skin stem cells.  Adult stem cells have the ability to make more stem cells and to generate the cells of a differentiated tissue. Skin stem cells can replenish the epidermis and make hair follicle cells. Skin grown in culture from just a few skin stem cells can be used to treat burn patients or replace damaged corneal epithelium.  Stem cells reside in specific niches or microenvironments and signals from the niche determine whether a stem cell is going to be quiescent or make tissue.  Fuchs’ lab has studied hair follicle stem cells for many years and has identified the signals that activate hair follicle stem cells as well as the specific set of transcription factors that are upregulated in the activated stem cells. They have shown that many of the genes turned on during stem cell activation are regulated by super enhancers which sense the niche environment. 

Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are commonly occurring, dangerous cancers that may originate from skin stem cells. By developing methods to identify the stem cells that will lead to cancer, Fuchs’ lab has been able to study how these cells differ from normal skin stem cells. They found that the gene expression profile in normal versus cancer stem cells is very different and is likely the result of differences in the cancer stem cell niche. The tumor microenvironment may include immune cells and greater proximity to TGF-beta secreting blood vessels. Fuchs’ lab showed that cancer stem cells exposed to TGF-beta had increased expression of proteins in the glutathione metabolism pathway; the same pathway which is involved in the breakdown of chemotherapy drugs. Further studies in SCC patients, showed a strong correlation between increased mRNA levels for glutathione pathway proteins and decreased survival. These results suggest that drugs which block TGF-beta activity, in combination with other chemotherapeutics, may be an effective therapy for some SCC.

Speaker Biography:
Elaine Fuchs is the Rebecca C. Lancefield Professor of Mammalian Cell Biology and Development at The Rockefeller University and an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Her lab studies the role of skin stem cells in homeostasis and wound repair and how these processes go awry in cancer and inflammatory diseases.  

Fuchs received her BS in chemistry from the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana and her PhD in biochemistry from Princeton.  She developed her interest in skin biology as a post-doctoral fellow with Howard Green at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Before joining Rockefeller University in 2002, Fuchs was a faculty member at the University of Chicago for twenty years. 
 
Fuchs’ many contributions to skin and stem cell biology have been recognized with myriad awards and honors including the National Medal of Science in 2008, the March of Dimes Prize in 2012, and the E.B. Wilson Prize from the American Society of Cell Biology in 2015, to name a few.  She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine.

TNF path :
TNF-alpha is a cytokine produced mainly by activated macrophages, and is the major extrinsic mediator of apoptosis. Most cells in the human body have two receptors for TNF-alpha: TNFR1 and TNFR2. The binding of TNF-alpha to TNFR1 has been shown to initiate the pathway that leads to caspase activation via the intermediate membrane proteins TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) and Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD). cIAP1/2 can inhibit TNF-α signaling by binding to TRAF2. FLIP inhibits the activation of caspase-8. Binding of this receptor can also indirectly lead to the activation of transcription factors involved in cell survival and inflammatory responses.[34] However, signalling through TNFR1 might also induce apoptosis in a caspase-independent manner. The link between TNF-alpha and apoptosis shows why an abnormal production of TNF-alpha plays a fundamental role in several human diseases, especially in autoimmune diseases.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rlk9ZzInzuA/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:12.630554

The Apoptosis is regulated by various genes but Bcl family of genes are the primary regulators of the apoptosis.

Apoptosis (from Ancient Greek ἀπόπτωσις ""falling off"") is a form of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms.[2] Biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes (morphology) and death. These changes include blebbing, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, chromosomal DNA fragmentation, and global[vague] mRNA decay. 
The initiation of apoptosis is tightly regulated by activation mechanisms, because once apoptosis has begun, it inevitably leads to the death of the cell. The two best-understood activation mechanisms are the intrinsic pathway (also called the mitochondrial pathway) and the extrinsic pathway.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f9uFqw5wBxw/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:12.631551

Yet these developments are not without disruption and peril. Familiar long-standing institutions, organizations and traditions disappear or transform beyond recognition. And while new media bring with them new possibilities for openness, transparency, engagement and participation, they also bring new possibilities for surveillance, manipulation, distraction and control. Critical thinking, the old mainstay of higher education, is no longer enough to prepare our youth for this world. We must create learning environments that inspire a way of being-in-the-world in which they can harness and leverage this new media environment as well as recognize and actively examine, question and even re-create the (increasingly digital) structures that shape our world.

Speaker:  Dr. Michael Wesch is an Associate Professor of Cultural Anthropology at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas. Michael is a cultural anthropologist exploring the effects of new media on society and culture. His YouTube videos have been viewed by millions. Michael has won several major awards for his work, including a Wired Magazine Rave Award, the John Culkin Award for Outstanding Praxis in Media Ecology, and he was named an Emerging Explorer by National Geographic. He has also won several teaching awards, including the 2008 CASE/Carnegie U.S. Professor of the Year for Doctoral and Research Universities.

dtjG9k5SqGc,TBPPM Learning Network,UCdnjTx3I8gbQPR1sqnedAWg,1602676016.0,TBPPM Webinar | How to pay for TB? Social Health Insurance Schemes for TB,"In this webinar, the focus is on TB-specific issues around the strategic purchasing of clinical services. This will be examined within the context of social health insurance schemes, with inputs from three countries in Asia: Indonesia, Philippines and Viet Nam.

For the effective engagement of private providers in quality TB care and prevention, there are at least two important areas in which governments have used strategic purchasing:

1. Procurement of the supportive and organizational services of an intermediary agency (typically an NGO), which then does the work of engaging, supporting and monitoring private providers who are supplying TB care and prevention;
2. Procurement of clinical TB services from individual providers or clinical care entities, often via payments made by a social health insurance scheme.

The overall outline of the webinar is as follows: 
1. Why and how should TB programs engage with social health insurance efforts?  - William Wells, USAID/Washington
2. Improved strategic purchasing of TB services through health insurance in Indonesia  - Prof. Hasbullah Thabrany, Chief of Party, Health Financing Activity, Results for Development, Jakarta and
Dr. Kalsum Komaryani, Head of the Center for Health Financing and Insurance, Government of Indonesia
3. Navigating the division of TB responsibilities between the Department of Health and the PhilHealth insurance scheme in the Philippines - Dr. Carlos Tan, Deputy Chief of Party, USAID's ProtectHealth Project, The Philippines
4. Comments on how Viet Nam’s situation contrasts with that of Indonesia and the Philippines:
Dr. Nguyen Cam Anh, Health System Strengthening Team Lead
Dr. Minh Pham Huy, HIV/AIDS Care & Treatment Specialist, USAID/Viet Nam
5. Q & A moderated by William Wells
------------
This webinar is the second in a two-part series exploring the strategic purchasing of TB services. The previous TBPPM webinar on strategic purchasing outlined the general principles of strategic purchasing of clinical care, with examples from India and China.

gdzmNwTLakg,The Royal Institution,UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw,1394634541.0,The Neuroscience of Memory - Eleanor Maguire,"There are two demos in this talk that you can try at home exploring how we perceive and recollect visual scenes:

1. Image distance demo:
You are given a 3 second countdown before seeing a quick sequence of two pictures of the same object, divided briefly by a visual mask. The challenge is to identify whether the second picture is the same view as the first, or whether it's moved closer or further away. Try it yourself http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzmNwTLakg&t=6m56s

2. Drawing from memory demo:
You have 15 seconds to look at a picture, which you'll then be asked to draw, as accurately as possible, from memory. Try it now http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzmNwTLakg&t=35m20s


Our memories are our lives, and a fundamental basis of our culture. Collective memoirs of the past both bind society together and shape our potential future. With our brains we can travel through time and space, calling to mind places of significance, evoking images and emotions of past experiences. It's no wonder, then, that we so desperately fear the prospect of memory loss.

Many regions of the brain are involved in memory, but one of the most critical components is the hippocampus, which plays a crucial role in the formation of long-term memories. Damage to the hippocampus can therefore result in significant memory loss.

In this Friday Evening Discourse, Eleanor Maguire draws on evidence from virtual reality, brain imaging and studies of amnesia to show that the consequences of hippocampal damage are even more far-reaching than suspected, robbing us of our past, our imagination and altering our perception of the world.

Maguire also explains how, despite our beliefs, our memories are not actually as accurate as you might think. In fact, they're not really even about the past.

xG2WOd_fWqo,Phospho Biomedical Animation,UC1XRLzoLZx3BiZkCFYVWSyA,1432181940.0,Cell signalling: kinases & phosphorylation,"The way in which the proteins in a cell transmit signals to one another is hugely important for controlling cell division, cell migration and even cell death. If this process goes wrong, it can lead to the onset of diseases such as cancer.

This is the first part of a series of animations exploring cell signalling, this time focusing on kinases and phosphorylations. Within a cell, phosphorylations are a major way in which proteins can transmit chemical signals to one another. In this video, we're exploring what you need in order to perform a phosphorylation, how it works and what happens when proteins are phosphorylated.

Below are some references of seminal papers in the field. Early sequence alignments of ~100 protein kinases showed remarkable conservation of particular amino acid motifs (1), and these same residues were found to be important to activity when scanning mutagenesis experiments tested activity after sequentially mutating kinase residues (2). While these conserved motifs are far apart in the amino acid sequence, the first structures of a kinase (3, 4) showed that they are all close to ATP and the substrate in three dimensional space. The original list of kinases was massively expanded to 518 members using data gathered from the Human Genome Project (5).

Mitosis is the process in which a eukaryotic cell nucleus splits in two, followed by division of the parent cell into two daughter cells. The word ""mitosis"" means ""threads,"" and it refers to the threadlike appearance of chromosomes as the cell prepares to divide. Early microscopists were the first to observe these structures, and they also noted the appearance of a specialized network of microtubules during mitosis. These tubules, collectively known as the spindle, extend from structures called centrosomes — with one centrosome located at each of the opposite ends, or poles, of a cell. As mitosis progresses, the microtubules attach to the chromosomes, which have already duplicated their DNA and aligned across the center of the cell. The spindle tubules then shorten and move toward the poles of the cell. As they move, they pull the one copy of each chromosome with them to opposite poles of the cell. This process ensures that each daughter cell will contain one exact copy of the parent cell DNA. 


Interphase: Cells may appear inactive during this stage, but they are quite the opposite. This is the longest period of the complete cell cycle during which DNA replicates, the centrioles divide, and proteins are actively produced. For a complete description of the events during Interphase, read about the Cell Cycle.

Prophase: During this first mitotic stage, the nucleolus fades and chromatin (replicated DNA and associated proteins) condenses into chromosomes. Each replicated chromosome comprises two chromatids, both with the same genetic information. Microtubules of the cytoskeleton, responsible for cell shape, motility and attachment to other cells during interphase, disassemble. And the building blocks of these microtubules are used to grow the mitotic spindle from the region of the centrosomes.

Prometaphase: In this stage the nuclear envelope breaks down so there is no longer a recognizable nucleus. Some mitotic spindle fibers elongate from the centrosomes and attach to kinetochores, protein bundles at the centromere region on the chromosomes where sister chromatids are joined. Other spindle fibers elongate but instead of attaching to chromosomes, overlap each other at the cell center.

Metaphase: Tension applied by the spindle fibers aligns all chromosomes in one plane at the center of the cell.

Anaphase: Spindle fibers shorten, the kinetochores separate, and the chromatids (daughter chromosomes) are pulled apart and begin moving to the cell poles.

Telophase: The daughter chromosomes arrive at the poles and the spindle fibers that have pulled them apart disappear.

Cytokinesis: The spindle fibers not attached to chromosomes begin breaking down until only that portion of overlap is left. It is in this region that a contractile ring cleaves the cell into two daughter cells. Microtubules then reorganize into a new cytoskeleton for the return to interphase.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DwAFZb8juMQ/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:14.628480

The lac operon (lactose operon) is an operon required for the transport and metabolism of lactose in Escherichia coli and many other enteric bacteria. Although glucose is the preferred carbon source for most bacteria, the lac operon allows for the effective digestion of lactose when glucose is not available through the activity of beta-galactosidase.


Gene regulation of the lac operon was the first genetic regulatory mechanism to be understood clearly, so it has become a foremost example of prokaryotic gene regulation. It is often discussed in introductory molecular and cellular biology classes for this reason. This lactose metabolism system was used by François Jacob and Jacques Monod to determine how a biological cell knows which enzyme to synthesize. Their work on the lac operon won them the Nobel Prize in Physiology in 1965.

E. coli encounters many different sugars in its environment. These sugars, such as lactose and glucose, require different enzymes for their metabolism. Three of the enzymes for lactose metabolism are grouped in the lac operon: lacZ, lacY, and lacA (Figure 12.2). LacZ encodes an enzyme called β-galactosidase, which digests lactose into its two constituent sugars: glucose and galactose. lacY is a permease that helps to transfer lactose into the cell. Finally, lacA is a trans-acetylase; the relevance of which in lactose metabolism is not entirely clear. Transcription of the lac operon normally occurs only when lactose is available for it to digest. Presumably, this avoids wasting energy in the synthesis of enzymes for which no substrate is present. A single mRNA transcript includes all three enzyme-coding sequences and is called polycistronic. A cistron is equivalent to a gene.

A second aspect of lac operon regulation is conferred by a trans-factor called cAMP binding protein (CAP, Figure 12.5). CAP is another example of an allosterically regulated trans-factor. Only when the CAP protein is bound to cAMP can another part of the protein bind to a specific cis-element within the lac promoter called the CAP binding sequence (CBS). CBS is located very close to the promoter (P). When CAP is bound to at CBS, RNA polymerase is better able to bind to the promoter and initiate transcription. Thus, the presence of cAMP ultimately leads to a further increase in lac operon transcription.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EjRXz1xAdow/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:15.035696
LBYLKd_XWOE,Shomu's Biology,UCEPMCywJ6FPZpQ_aPEZt5JA,1432990461.0,Gene regulation in prokaryotes,"This lecture explains about the Gene regulation in prokaryotes. 
Regulation of gene expression entails a broad range of mechanisms that are used by cells to develop or diminish the production of specific gene products (protein or RNA), and is informally termed gene legislation. Subtle applications of gene expression are greatly located in biology, for example to trigger developmental pathways, respond to environmental stimuli, or adapt to new food sources. Practically any step of gene expression may also be modulated, from transcriptional initiation, to RNA processing, and to the put up-translational amendment of a protein.

Gene law is main for viruses, prokaryotes and eukaryotes as it raises the flexibility and suppleness of an organism via allowing the mobile to express protein when wanted. Despite the fact that as early as 1951 Barbara McClintock confirmed interplay between two genetic loci, Activator (Ac) and Dissociator (Ds), within the color formation of maize seeds, the primary discovery of a gene legislation procedure is largely regarded to be the identification in 1961 of the lac operon, learned by means of Jacques Monod, where some enzymes concerned in lactose metabolism are expressed with the aid of the genome of E. Coli most effective in the presence of lactose and absence of glucose.

Furthermore, in multicellular organisms, gene legislation drives the approaches of mobile differentiation and morphogenesis, leading to the creation of specific mobilephone types that possess distinct gene expression profiles, and as a consequence produce distinctive proteins/have different ultrastructures that swimsuit them to their features (though all of them possess the genotype, which follows the equal genome sequence).

The initiating event leading to a change in gene expression comprise activation or deactivation of receptors. Also, there may be evidence that alterations in a cell's choice of catabolism results in altered gene expressions.

i7bFtZ4J9ao,Shomu's Biology,UCEPMCywJ6FPZpQ_aPEZt5JA,1359810116.0,Lac operon,"This lecture explains about Lac operon concept in E.coli.
http://shomusbiology.weebly.com/
Download the study materials here-
http://shomusbiology.weebly.com/bio-materials.html
The lac operon is an operon required for the transport and metabolism of lactose in Escherichia coli and some other enteric bacteria. It consists of three adjacent structural genes, lacz, lacy, and lacA. The genes encode β-galactosidase, lactose permease, and thiogalactoside transacetylase (or galactoside O-acetyltransferase), respectively.

In its natural environment, the lac operon allows for the effective digestion of lactose. The lactose permease, which sits in the cytoplasmic membrane, transports lactose into the cell. β-galactosidase, a cytoplasmic enzyme, subsequently cleaves lactose into glucose and galactose. However it would be wasteful to produce the enzymes when there is no lactose available or if there is a more preferable energy source available such as glucose. Gene regulation of the lac operon was the first genetic regulatory mechanism to be understood clearly and is one of the foremost examples of prokaryotic gene regulation.
The lac operon uses a two-part control mechanism to ensure that the cell expends energy producing the enzymes encoded by the lac operon only when necessary. It achieves this primarily with the lac repressor, which halts the production in the absence of lactose, and EIIAGlc, which shuts down lactose permease when glucose is being transported into the cell. This dual control mechanism causes the sequential utilization of glucose and lactose in two distinct growth phases, known as diauxie. Source of the article published in description is Wikipedia.

NGVP4J9jpgs,JJ Medicine,UCFPvnkCZbHfBvV8ApBBE0vA,1512584250.0,"Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway | Overview, Purpose and APC Mutations","Lesson on the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway (also known as simply the Wnt signaling pathway), including an introduction to the pathway, Wnt growth stimulatory factors, β-Catenin regulation and role of the pathway in growth, proliferation and development. Wnt proteins act as The Wnt signaling pathway is critically important in embryonic development, particularly in the development of the heart. As such the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway is highly conserved. However, if mutations occur in proteins in the pathway, such as mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, this can lead to inappropriate activation of the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway. 

NOTE: In the video, I misspoke and said that Beta catenin enters the ""mitochondria"" - I meant to say it enters the nucleus. Sorry about the confusion everyone. Hope you find the video helpful :) 

Hey everyone, here is another biomedical lesson, and this one is on the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. In this lesson, you will be introduced to the Wnt signaling pathway, and the purpose of the Wnt pathway. You will also learn the signaling pathway in a step-by-step fashion, starting with how the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway is regulated during inactivation, how cellular beta catenin levels are regulated by the destruction complex, and how the pathway can become activated by the extracellular signaling Wnt proteins, which are growth stimulatory factors. Finally, you will learn what happens when the APC protein in the destruction complex is mutated, leading to inappropriate activation of the Wnt signaling pathway.

KwkkOIwqQZI,Shomu's Biology,UCEPMCywJ6FPZpQ_aPEZt5JA,1427811407.0,BRCA mutation,"This breast cancer lecture explains about the brca gene (brca1 and brca2 mechanism) mutation which leads to the development of breast cancer.
A BRCA mutation is a mutation in both of the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Detrimental mutations in these tumor suppressor genes produce a hereditary breast-ovarian melanoma syndrome in affected families. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are distinctive, and breast cancer is relatively original, so these mutations consequently account for only five to ten percent of all breast cancer cases in women.

1000s of distinctive types of mutations in these genes have been recognized. Excessive-danger mutations, which disable an primary error-free DNA repair procedure (homology directed repair), tremendously develop the character's threat of setting up breast cancer, ovarian melanoma and specific different cancers. Why BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations lead preferentially to cancers of the breast and ovary is not identified, but lack of BRCA1 function seems to result in non-useful x-chromosome inactivation. No longer all mutations are excessive-chance; some show up to be harmless editions. The cancer hazard related to any given mutation varies greatly and depends on the distinctive variety and area of the mutation and in all probability different person reasons.

Ladies with unsafe mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 have risk of breast melanoma that is about five occasions the average chance, and a hazard of ovarian cancer that's about ten to thirty occasions common. BRCA1 mutations typically confer a higher danger of breast and ovarian melanoma in females than BRCA2 mutations. Having a high-threat mutation does no longer guarantee that the girl will increase any sort of cancer, or warranty that any melanoma that appears was once genuinely induced through the mutation, alternatively than every other element, like alcohol consumption.

Gww6iaCATH4,Mark Temple,UCYtiR9XcY0kUagbkgJW0kVg,1501812890.0,2.5 The case of  Burkitt’s lymphoma,"Careful examination of metaphase chromosome spreads of these tumor cells did revealed the tumor cells almost invariably carried chromosomal translocations 

Such alterations fuse a region from one chromosome with another region from a second, unrelated chromosome

Chromosomal Translocations 
Translocations such as these are often found to be reciprocal.
The chromosomal region from chromosome A lands on chromosome B, 
the displaced segment of chromosome B ends up being linked to chromosome A. 

Chromosomal Translocations 
Burkitt’s lymphoma
In the case of Burkitt’s lymphomas, three distinct, alternative chromosomal translocations were found, involving human Chromosomes 2, 14, or 22. 

The three translocations were united by the fact that in each case, a region from one of these three chromosomes was fused to a section of Chromosome 8. 

What is it about Chromosome 8?
The myc proto-oncogene could be found in the region on human Chromosome 8 that is involved in these translocations. 

On the other side of the fusion site (often termed the chromosomal breakpoint) were found the transcription-promoting sequences from any one of three distinct immunoglobulin (antibody) genes.
the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene cluster is found on Chromosome 14
the K antibody light-chain gene is located on Chromosome 2
the 2 antibody light-chain gene is found on Chromosome 22


Translocations separate myc from its promoter 
The enzymes responsible for rearranging the sequences of antibody genes inadvertently fuse part of an antibody gene with the myc proto-oncogene.

These translocations separate the myc gene from its normal transcriptional promoter and place it under the control of one of three highly active transcriptional regulators
each from an immunoglobulin gene 
Many distinct chromosomal translocations have been found to cause deregulated expression of known proto-oncogenes
Most of these genes remain poorly characterized",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gww6iaCATH4/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:16.067748

Webinar:
Destabilization and Degradation of MYC: More Ways Than One

Webinar Abstract:
The oncogenic transcription factor c-MYC (MYC) is deregulated, and often overexpressed, in more than 50% of cancers. MYC deregulation is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive disease, suggesting that the development of therapeutic inhibitors targeting MYC would dramatically impact patient care and outcome. MYC is a highly regulated transcription factor, with a protein and mRNA half-life of approximately 30 min. The most extensively studied pathway regulating MYC protein stability involves ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation mediated by the E3-ligase, SCFFbxw7. We provide evidence for a SCFFBXW7-independent regulatory mechanism centered on Lysine 52 (K52) within MYC Box I (MBI) of the MYC protein. This residue has been shown to be post-translationally modified by both ubiquitylation and SUMOylation, hinting at the interplay of post-translational modifications at this site, and the importance of this residue. We demonstrate that mutation of K52 to arginine (R) renders the MYC protein more labile. Mechanistically, we show that the degradation pathway regulated by K52 is independent of the Cullin-Ring-Ligase (CRL) family of E3-ligases, which includes not only the canonical SCFFBXW7, but also a number of other known MYC-targeting E3-ligases, such as SCFSKP2, SCFβTCRP, SCFFBXO28 and DCXTRUSS. To characterize this degradation pathway further we will utilize unbiased and targeted experiments to elucidate the proteins involved. Taken together, our data identifies a novel regulatory pathway centred on K52 that may be exploited for the development of anti-MYC therapeutics. 

Learning Objectives: 

1. Learn about the critical role of MYC in tumorigenesis
2. Understand the relationship between the amount of MYC protein in the cell and its tumorigenicity
3. Understand how the stability of the MYC protein is regulated in the cell

Mutations of the k-Ras gene arise in over ninety% of pancreatic carcinomas. No different human tumor comes shut in mutational frequency. The ras pathway is most important within the transmission of growth-selling alerts from the telephone floor receptors, ultimately toward the nucleus where these alerts have an effect on the creation and regulation of other key proteins. It's exciting that despite the fact that most mutations in genes are expected to reason their inactivation, with the Ras genes the reverse happens - they emerge as more energetic in signalling. This is considering of the engineering design of the protein. The ras sign is became off by using a molecular switch, which depends upon an enzyme endeavor. In picturesque terms, the nucleotide GTP (guanidine triphosphate) engages the swap to maintain it within the ""on"" state. A component to the Ras protein has an enzyme endeavor (a GTPase) which cleaves the GTP. This turns the change ""off"" after the temporary ""on"" period. Definitely, the mutations of Ras do indeed inactivate a operate, as most mutations are anticipated to do. The GTPase is inactivated via the mutations. However this now signifies that GTP continues to interact the change, and the Ras signalling function is unable to be grew to become ""off"". A quantity of drug firms at the moment are investigating ways to abate the signalling perform of Ras, which might provide a rational cure for pancreatic cancer.

Excessive, abnormal and uncontrolled growth of body cell is called cancer.  Cancer is the name given to a collection of related diseases. In all types of cancer, some of the body’s cells begin to divide without stopping and spread into surrounding tissues. Many cancers form solid tumours, which are masses of tissue. Cancers of the blood, such as leukaemias, generally do not form solid tumours. Cancerous tumours are malignant, which means they can spread into, or invade nearby tissues. In addition, as these tumours grow, some cancer cells can break off and travel to distant places in the body through the blood or the lymph system and form new tumours far from the original tumour.
Unlike malignant tumours, benign tumours do not spread into, or invade nearby tissues. Benign tumours can sometimes be quite large, however, when removed, they usually don’t grow back, whereas malignant tumours sometimes do. Unlike most benign tumours elsewhere in the body, benign brain tumours can be life-threatening. 

Metastatic cancer has the same name and the same type of cancer cells as the original, or primary, cancer. For example, breast cancer that spreads to and forms a metastatic tumour in the lung is metastatic breast cancer, not lung cancer.
Symptoms of cancer may be following found in patients with different cancers: fatigue, weight loss, pain, skin changes, change in bowel or bladder function, unusual bleeding, persistent cough or voice change, fever, lumps, or tissue masses.

Alkylating agents are compounds that work by adding an alkyl group to the guanine base of the DNA molecule, preventing the strands of the double helix from linking as they should. This causes breakage of the DNA strands, affecting the ability of the cancer cell to multiply. Eventually, the cancer cell dies. Alkylating agents were one of the first classes of drugs to be used against cancer. There are five traditional categories of alkylating agents:

(1) Nitrogen mustards (eg, bendamustine, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, mechlorethamine, melphalan)
(2) Nitrosoureas (eg, carmustine, lomustine, streptozocin) 
(3) Alkyl sulfonates (eg, busulfan)
(4) Triazines (eg, dacarbazine, temozolomide)
(5) Ethylenimines (eg, altretamine, thiotepa)

The fas receptor (First apoptosis signal) – (also known as Apo-1 or CD95) is a transmembrane protein of the TNF family which binds the Fas ligand (FasL). The interaction between Fas and FasL results in the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), which contains the FADD, caspase-8 and caspase-10. In some types of cells (type I), processed caspase-8 directly activates other members of the caspase family, and triggers the execution of apoptosis of the cell. In other types of cells (type II), the Fas-DISC starts a feedback loop that spirals into increasing release of proapoptotic factors from mitochondria and the amplified activation of caspase-8.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f8CpWl-Tqf8/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:16.515335

Thank you for watching

The mitochondria are predominant to multicellular lifestyles. Without them, a phone ceases to respire aerobically and speedily dies. This fact types the basis for some apoptotic pathways. Apoptotic proteins that goal mitochondria impact them in unique methods. They may purpose mitochondrial swelling by way of the formation of membrane pores, or they'll develop the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and motive apoptotic effectors to leak out.[15] These are very intently concerning intrinsic pathway, and tumors arise extra mainly through intrinsic pathway than the extrinsic pathway for the reason that of sensitivity.[18] there is also a growing physique of proof indicating that nitric oxide is able to set off apoptosis by using helping to dissipate the membrane capabilities of mitochondria and for this reason make it more permeable.[14] A study done in 1999 exhibits how nitric oxide can each initiate and inhibit apoptosis due to the cellular variables.[19]

Mitochondrial proteins known as SMACs (small mitochondria-derived activator of caspases) are released into the cytosol following an develop in permeability. SMAC binds to inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and deactivates them, preventing the IAPs from arresting the apoptotic approach and hence permitting apoptosis to proceed. IAP also as a rule suppresses the undertaking of a group of cysteine proteases called caspases,[20] which carry out the degradation of the telephone, accordingly the exact degradation enzymes will also be obvious to be indirectly regulated with the aid of mitochondrial permeability.

Cytochrome c can be released from mitochondria due to formation of a channel, the mitochondrial apoptosis-brought on channel (MAC), within the outer mitochondrial membrane,[21] and serves a regulatory perform because it precedes morphological alternate related to apoptosis.[15] once cytochrome c is released it binds with Apoptotic protease activating element - 1 (Apaf-1) and ATP, which then bind to pro-caspase-9 to create a protein difficult known as an apoptosome. The apoptosome cleaves the pro-caspase to its active type of caspase-9, which in turn activates the effector caspase-three.

MAC, also known as ""Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization Pore"" is regulated by using quite a lot of proteins, corresponding to these encoded by means of the mammalian Bcl-2 household of anti-apoptopic genes, the homologs of the ced-9 gene discovered in C. Elegans.[22][23] Bcl-2 proteins are ready to promote or inhibit apoptosis by way of direct action on MAC/MOMPP. Bax and/or Bak kind the pore, at the same time Bcl-2, Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 inhibit its formation.

Thanks for watching!  
I love making these for you!

I'm constantly trying to make (and find) better videos for you to study from **it’s not easy!  **You can help by suggesting any good videos you've seen in the comments below!

Good luck in school!!

I'm sure that you've talked about the G protein-linked receptors in school, however, you might not have called them G protein-linked receptors.
They go by other names like G protein-linked second messengers or G protein-coupled receptors, that's a pretty common one.
Even conversationally, a lot of people just say the G proteins.
I'm gonna break down those words a little bit later and tell you what each part of it means and why we use those names to refer to these proteins.
But first off, what does the G stand for? Why is it G protein? Well, the G stands for guanine.
These are guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, meaning that they bind guanine nucleotides.
Like for example guanosine triphosphate or its slightly shorter little brother, guanosine diphosphate.
These receptors are extremely important physiologically.
We use them all over our body and they do all kinds of different functions.
These receptors are only found in eukaryotes and are the target of about 40% of all the drugs we use in medicine today.
I just told you that they're very diverse in function however, there's two main signal transduction pathways that you got to know, you have to know them for your boards and that is the cyclic AMP-dependent pathway and the phosphatidylinositol signal pathway, okay? I'll talk about those more in a little bit.
First, let's jump into the structure and function of these things, it's pretty cool.
I told you that I was going to breakdown the names so that you can understand the concepts a little bit better.
First off, let's get started with what does the word ""G proteins"" mean? Well, the G proteins are a component of this receptor system.
The G proteins are heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins made of three subunits, hence, heterotrimeric.
First there's the alpha subunit, then the beta subunit and then the gamma subunit.
And you should also notice from my illustration here that the beta and gamma subunits are more tightly linked together than the two are to the alpha subunit.
Actually the beta and the gamma stay connected where the alpha subunit separates itself in normal function.
These G proteins live on the intracellular side of the cell membrane and are attached to or connected to the cell membrane itself by lipid anchors.
The next thing for us to talk about is to define what are the G protein-coupled receptors? Well, these are receptors that live in the membrane and in fact, they pass through the membrane seven times which is an important number, you might be tested on it.
All right, so these G protein-coupled receptors interact with the G proteins and cause oftentimes a confirmational change so that the alpha subunit of the G protein can accept different nucleotides.
What about the term G protein-linked second messengers? Well, that's another component of this system which are cellular target-proteins or enzymes that perform some kind of function when they interact with the G proteins that we've already talked about.
Now they are very diverse but as I said in the beginning, there's two main pathways or two main targets that cause a pathway that you have to understand.
And those two are the cyclic AMP-dependent pathway and the phosphatidylinositol signal pathway, which I abbreviate here as IP3/DAG pathway.
Right now you're probably thinking, Dr. Joel, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Don't worry, I will show you the whole thing working and we'll talk about the parts as we go, and I'm pretty sure that it will make sense after we go through it.
First, we have to set the stage a little bit.
The G proteins or more specifically, the alpha subunit of the G proteins is bound in its resting state to guanosine diphosphate or GDP.
In this state, the receptor is just sitting and waiting.
On the extracellular side of the cell membrane, a ligand comes and it binds with the G protein-coupled receptor causing a confirmational change.
The confirmational change allows the alpha subunit to bind with guanosine triphosphate and release the guanosine diphosphate.
Now, the G proteins are active and as active G proteins, they do a couple of things.
First off, the alpha subunit separates itself from the beta gamma complex.
This kind of frees it up a little bit so it's free to move around.
It's still attached to the membrane by a lipid anchor but the lipid anchor can kind of swim through the membranes.
It's able to move to the target.
It moves the target and it causes the target protein or enzyme to change in some way.
Either the G protein interaction causes the target to speed up what it's doing or slow down what it's doing or stop what it's doing.
It does something to the target protein.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3qR9B2JCT_s/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:16.830476

5_1R6n7-190,Hussain Biology,UCDCg5AAslixldHh5D7Nu6-g,1597729295.0,bcr-abl Translocation  Mechanism | Philadelphia Chromosome,"The Philadelphia chromosome or Philadelphia translocation (Ph) is a specific genetic abnormality in chromosome 22 of leukemia cancer cells (particularly chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells). This chromosome is defective and unusually short because of reciprocal translocation, t(9;22)(q34;q11), of genetic material between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22, and contains a fusion gene called BCR-ABL1. This gene is the ABL1 gene of chromosome 9 juxtaposed onto the breakpoint cluster region BCR gene of chromosome 22, coding for a hybrid protein: a tyrosine kinase signalling protein that is ""always on"", causing the cell to divide uncontrollably by interrupting the stability of the genome and impairing various signaling pathways governing the cell cycle.

The chromosomal defect in the Philadelphia chromosome is a reciprocal translocation, in which parts of two chromosomes, 9 and 22, swap places. The result is that a fusion gene is created by juxtaposing the ABL1 gene on chromosome 9 (region q34) to a part of the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22 (region q11). This is a reciprocal translocation, creating an elongated chromosome 9 (termed a derivative chromosome, or der 9), and a truncated chromosome 22 (the Philadelphia chromosome, 22q-).In agreement with the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN), this chromosomal translocation is designated as t(9;22)(q34;q11). The symbol ABL1 is derived from Abelson, the name of a leukemia virus which carries a similar protein. The symbol BCR is derived from breakpoint cluster region, a gene which encodes a protein that acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho GTPase proteins .
Translocation results in an oncogenic BCR-ABL1 gene fusion that can be found on the shorter derivative chromosome 22. This gene encodes for a BCR-ABL1 fusion protein. Depending on the precise location of fusion, the molecular weight of this protein can range from 185 to 210 kDa. Consequently, the hybrid BCR-ABL1 fusion protein is referred to as p210 or p185.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5_1R6n7-190/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:17.906623
kXARLswaJXs,Shomu's Biology,UCEPMCywJ6FPZpQ_aPEZt5JA,1384831787.0,proto-oncogene activation,"For more information, log on to-
http://shomusbiology.weebly.com/
Download the study materials here-
http://shomusbiology.weebly.com/bio-materials.html
Source of the article published in description is Wikipedia. Thanks to original content developers.
Link- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page
The proto-oncogene can become an oncogene by a relatively small modification of its original function. There are three basic methods of activation:

    A mutation within a proto-oncogene, or within a regulatory region (for example the promoter region), can cause a change in the protein structure, causing
        an increase in protein (enzyme) activity
        a loss of regulation
    An increase in the amount of a certain protein (protein concentration), caused by
        an increase of protein expression (through misregulation)
        an increase of protein (mRNA) stability, prolonging its existence and thus its activity in the cell
        gene duplication (one type of chromosome abnormality), resulting in an increased amount of protein in the cell
    A chromosomal translocation (another type of chromosome abnormality)
        There are 2 different types of chromosomal translocations that can occur:
        translocation events which relocate a proto-oncogene to a new chromosomal site that leads to higher expression
        translocation events that lead to a fusion between a proto-oncogene and a 2nd gene (this creates a fusion protein with increased cancerous/oncogenic activity)
            the expression of a constitutively active hybrid protein. This type of mutation in a dividing stem cell in the bone marrow leads to adult leukemia
            Philadelphia Chromosome is an example of this type of translocation event. This chromosome was discovered in 1960 by Peter Nowell and David Hungerford, and it is a fusion of parts of DNA from chromosome 22 and chromosome 9. The broken end of chromosome 22 contains the ""BCR"" gene, which fuses with a fragment of chromosome 9 that contains the ""ABL1"" gene. When these two chromosome fragments fuse the genes also fuse creating a new gene: ""BCR-ABL"". This fused gene encodes for a protein that displays high protein tyrosine kinase activity (this activity is due to the ""ABL1"" half of the protein). The unregulated expression of this protein activates other proteins that are involved in cell cycle and cell division which can cause a cell to grow and divide uncontrollably (the cell becomes cancerous). As a result, the Philadelphia Chromosome is associated with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (as mentioned before) as well as other forms of Leukemia.[13]

The expression of oncogenes can be regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs), small RNAs 21-25 nucleotides in length that control gene expression by downregulating them.[14] Mutations in such microRNAs (known as oncomirs) can lead to activation of oncogenes.[15] Antisense messenger RNAs could theoretically be used to block the effects of oncogenes.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kXARLswaJXs/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:17.906623

Cancer biologist Andre Ventura explains how his lab uses genetically engineered mouse models to understand how cancer works, why we get cancer, and how his research helps discover new targets for cancer therapy.

{partial transcript}

What I would like to do right now is bring up one of the stars of tonight, Dr. Andre Ventura.

I told the three of them that I would not read aloud their bios, since it’s in the handout provided. You can read about all the cool things that they have done and all the things that they’re distinguished for. 

I want to give just a little introduction to you all about why Andre’s work is so important. About ten to fifteen years ago, we became to appreciate their biologist evolutionary process that evolved from very simple molecules to become organized cells.

We needed to know what was the first molecule that really mattered and started to create life. That molecule by all estimates is an RNA molecule. That started a change in all of our thinking about biology, which is that we used to think of RNA as this very simple information transfer between critical information stored in the DNA and your cells.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yuvtrho7ehg/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:18.111363

Part 1: microRNA Biogenesis and Regulation: Narry Kim takes us through the steps in microRNA biogenesis and explains the importance of microRNAs in regulating protein-coding mRNAs.

Part 2: Tailing in the Regulation of microRNA and Beyond: Modifications, such as uridylation, of the 3’ tail of both microRNAs and mRNAs can regulate RNA function by targeting it for degradation. 

Talk Overview:
Small RNAs (~20-30 nucleotides in length) are found in many eukaryotes and act to guard against unwanted RNA such as viruses, transposons and mRNAs. One family of small RNAs called microRNAs regulates protein-coding mRNAs by binding to the 3’UTR and repressing translation or inducing mRNA decay. microRNAs play a key role in animal development and diseases such as cancer.  In her first talk, Dr. Narry Kim gives a step-by-step description of the microRNA biogenesis pathway and the points at which the pathway can be regulated.

In her second talk, Kim focuses on the regulation of microRNA function. A small percentage of microRNAs are modified with untemplated nucleotides, usually A or U, added to their 3’ end or “tail”. “Tailing” can modify the microRNA function and in some cases it can act as a molecular switch resulting in developmental and pathological transitions.  Kim’s lab was interested in knowing if tailing occurs on other RNAs such as mRNA. They developed a novel method to sequence the 3’ tail region of mRNA allowing them to measure polyA tail length and detect 3’ terminal modifications.  Interestingly, they found widespread uridylation of mRNAs and showed that 3’ polyU modification serves to mark mRNA for decay.  

Speaker Biography:
Narry Kim is Director of the Institute for Basic Science and a Professor at Seoul National University.  Her lab studies RNA-mediated gene regulation using stem cells, early embryos, and neuronal cells as model systems. 
 
Kim received her BA and MS degrees in microbiology from Seoul National University and her DPhil in biochemistry from Oxford University.  She was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania in Gideon Dreyfuss’ lab before returning to Seoul National University as a faculty member.  
 
Kim is on the editorial board of a number of journals and has helped to organize many meetings on RNA biology.  Her research and contributions to the life sciences community have been recognized with numerous awards including the Women in Science Award from L’Oreal-UNESCO (2008) and the Ho-Am Prize in medicine (2009). In 2014, Kim was elected to the Korean Academy of Science and Technology and the National Academy of Sciences USA.

Biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes (morphology) and death. These changes include blebbing, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, chromosomal DNA fragmentation, and global mRNA decay. Between 50 and 70 billion cells die each day due to apoptosis in the average human adult.
 For an average child between the ages of 8 and 14, approximately 20 to 30 billion cells die a day.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hb7-QZY8Gd0/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:18.341262

The number of cells in a tissue is determined by the balance between cell division and cell death. Uncontrollable cell division leads to formation of abnormal growths called tumors. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors are slow-growing and constrained by surrounding connective tissue so they do not spread to other organs. They can still be harmful or even kill by pressing on nearby nerves, brain tissue or blood vessels. Examples of benign tumor include pituitary tumors which may press on optic nerves and cause loss of vision. Cancers are malignant tumors - tumors that can spread beyond of the limit of original organ where it comes from and to other organs of the body.
How cancer starts
Cancer starts from damage in the DNA of a cell. This DNA damage is called mutation. Mutations happen when the cell duplicates its DNA prior to cell division and makes mistakes. These damages are usually detected and repaired before the cell can divide but sometimes, some of them may be ignored and transferred to daughter cells.
If the mutation is located in one of many genes that control the cell cycle, it may affect the regulation of cell cycle in the cell carrying it, and make the cell divide faster than it supposed to. Usually, one mutation is not enough to cause cancer, but as it makes the cell cycle control less reliable, many more DNA damages/mutations would go unnoticed. Cancer is usually the result of accumulation of many mutations of genes involved in cell cycle control and DNA repair. This commonly happens over a long period of time, over many rounds of cell divisions, and this explains why cancers are more common in older people.
Some people are said to be predisposed to cancer. This is because they are born with a mutation that makes them more likely to develop a certain type of cancer. This mutation alone is not enough to cause cancer but it starts the process of making cells cancerous. The person carrying it is one step further down the road towards developing a cancer than others who do not have the mutation.
How cancer spreads
Cancer cells do not stick together like normal cells, they move and invade nearby tissues, organs, this is local spread. They may also spread to further away organs by means of blood and lymph circulation, this is systemic spread. Metastasis is the spreading of cancers to non-adjacent organs. Cancer cells from the original tumor, or primary cancer, can break out and maybe taken up by a blood or a lymph vessel for a ride throughout the body. They can then squeeze out from the vessels into other tissues and start a new tumor growth in the new location which will become secondary cancer. 
 Where do cancers usually spread and why?
While travelling in the bloodstream, cancer cell usually stops at the first place where the vessel getting so narrow that it gets stuck. As blood flow from most organs goes to the capillaries of the lungs, this is where cancers spread the most. Lungs are indeed the most common site of secondary cancers.
Likewise, while travelling in the lymphatic system, cancer cells commonly get stuck in nearest lymph nodes, where the vessels get narrower. This is the reason why surgeons usually remove nearby lymph nodes when removing tumors.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GhfrHjBX5eA/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:19.212502

2ccNgxyPnBs,Mark Temple,UCYtiR9XcY0kUagbkgJW0kVg,1502410564.0,3.4 Loss of heterozygosity (LOH),"Mitotic recombination may contribute to Rb is inactivation 
Recombination between chromosomes was known to occur almost exclusively during meiosis. 

What about mitotic recombination between:
one of the chromatid arms carrying the wild- type Rb allele and
one carrying the mutant allele 

one is of paternal origin
the other of maternal origin

Mitotic recombination
the chromosomes would both remain full-length and indistinguishable from the chromosomes that existed prior to this genetic exchange.

(unlike the chromosomal translocations of Burkitt’s lymphoma during meiosis)

Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) 
Mitotic recombination was found to occur at a frequency of up to 10-4 per cell generation. 

This is a far easier way for a cell to rid itself of the remaining wild-type copy of the Rb gene than mutational inactivation

Following the mitotic recombination they lose heterozygosity and become homozygous.
 
Gene Conversion can achieve LOH. 
A DNA strand being elongated during DNA replication on one chromosome will form a hybrid with the complementary DNA strand present in the second, homologous chromosome. 
this newly synthesized strand of DNA will acquire DNA sequences from a stretch of the paired chromosome. 

Such gene conversion is known to occur even more frequently per cell generation than does mitotic recombination. 

Evidence of LOH
Retinoblastoma tumor cells were predicted to show LOH at the Rb locus 
i.e. the same mutation on both chromosomes

Only a small minority were predicted to carry two distinct, mutant alleles of Rb, (each inactivated by an independent mutational event)",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2ccNgxyPnBs/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:19.392619
pKIxQsSbRA8,Shomu's Biology,UCEPMCywJ6FPZpQ_aPEZt5JA,1427336602.0,Point mutation,"This DNA mutation lecture explains about types of point mutations like nonsense mutation, missense mutation, silent mutation etc.
A mutation is a everlasting exchange somewhere in a DNA sequence. DNA is the unit of heredity of all organisms, so this means that mutations can most often be handed on to offspring. Mutations do not have got to be bad. Some are worthy, whilst others are impartial or don't have any effect. There are a lot of one of a kind categories of mutations, however in this lesson we can center of attention on factor mutations, or these attributable to a metamorphosis in a single or a fewnucleotides at a single area in a DNA sequence.
A mutation that includes a single nucleotide and may consist of lack of a nucleotide, substitution of a nucleotide for another, or the insertion of an extra nucleotide. 

For instance, sickle-mobile disorder is triggered with the aid of a single factor mutation (a missense mutation) within the beta-hemoglobin gene at role 6 that converts a GAG codon into GTG, which encodes the amino acid valine as a substitute than glutamic acid.

Cancer immunology is the study of interactions between the immune system and cancer cells (also called tumors or malignancies). It is a growing field of research that aims to discover innovative cancer immunotherapies to treat and retard progression of the disease. The immune response, including the recognition of cancer-specific antigens is of particular interest in the field as knowledge gained drives the development of new vaccines and antibody therapies. For instance in 2007, Ohtani published a paper finding tumour infiltrating lymphocytes to be quite significant in human colorectal cancer.[1] The host was given a better chance at survival if the cancer tissue showed infiltration of inflammatory cells, in particular those prompting lymphocytic reactions. The results yielded suggest some extent of anti-tumour immunity is present in colorectal cancers in humans.

Over the past 10 years there has been notable progress and an accumulation of scientific evidence for the concept of cancer immunosurveillance and immunoediting based on (i) protection against development of spontaneous and chemically-induced tumors in animal systems and (ii) identification of targets for immune recognition of human cancer.
Cancer immunosurveillance is a theory formulated in 1957 by Burnet and Thomas, who proposed that lymphocytes act as sentinels in recognizing and eliminating continuously arising, nascent transformed cells.[2][3] Cancer immunosurveillance appears to be an important host protection process that decreases cancer rates through inhibition of carcinogenesis and maintaining of regular cellular homeostasis.[4] It has also been suggested that immunosurveillance primarily functions as a component of a more general process of cancer immunoediting.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2mdoNISQ8uc/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:19.557324

Innate immunity is the fast response against pathogen with cell mediated immunity and it's less specific. While adaptive immunity takes some time to develop but it is more effective and much more specific.

8VSgOeJy4dQ,Mechanisms in Medicine,UCvl8mk9dKfhidf8oVhYkaOg,1351279979.0,Introduction to Cancer Biology (Part 2): Loss of Apoptosis,"Apoptosis or ""programmed cell death"" is a mechanism by which organisms limit the growth and replication of cells. Loss of apoptosis is one of the key mechanisms behind cancer.
This animation is the second part of the series ""An Introduction to Cancer Biology"", and reveals the faulty apoptotic pathways that tumor cells often have.

Adenocarcinoma is the most common right now and is the most common. It is the third most common cancer and is the most common cause of cancer death. 

RISK FACTORS OF LUNG CANCER
Smoking, Asbestos, Radiation, Arsenic Chromium, Nickel. 
Genetics, Scar Formation (Wegeners, Fibrosis, Scleroderma)
Air pollution, HIV. 

CLINICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF LUNG CANCER
Pulmonary Symptoms, most common is cough, Hemoptysis (which ca lead to asphyxia) Chest Pain (dull achy), Dyspnea (secondary to pneumonia, atelectasis, lymphatic tumor spread, pleural effusion and pneumothorax), hoarsenes (when laryngeal nerve involved), pleural effusion (serous, serosangiounous, bloody) which may be caused by metastasis into pleural fluid. Super Vena Cava Syndrome occurs when central tumor invades SVC which causes red, edematous face, prominent veins throughout the body and this is more common in small cell lung cancer. Pancoast tumor is a lung cancer located in the apex of the lungs. Pancoast tumor may lead to thoracic outlet syndrome (pain weakness in arm and hand). Horner Syndrome causes miosis, anhydrosis and ptosis (MAP) and this is more common in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer. 

Paraneoplastic syndromes are due to hypercalcemia (PTHrP) bone mets, calcitriol release, cytokine. SIADH causes increase water absorption leading to dilution hyponatremia, cerebral edema, anorexia, nausea vomiting. Resolves with chemo and treatment. Lambert Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) is a condition with auto-antibodies of the calcium channels in the Neuromuscular Junction. Proximal Muscle weakness and rising and standing. Hematologic derangements such as anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis and hypercoagulability. Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy may lead to digital clubbing, periositis, Arthralgia, Cushings due to release of Ectopic ACTH.

Metastasis symptoms occur when metastasis of lung cancer to liver, adrenal gland, Lung, Spine, Brain. Screen with PET-CT. 

INVESTIGATIONS FOR LUNG CANCER
X-Ray may show a coin lesion. First step in management is to look at a previous x-ray and look for a sign of lung cancer on the old x-ray. 

Cytology of the sputum, bronchoscopy, and percutaneous. 

CT Scan and PET CT

Small Cell Lung Cancer
Oat cells look like small cells with little cytoplasm. All are of neuroendocrine origin (feyrter cells) on bronchus. Small Cell Lung Cancer is found central and has limited stage (Lung and 1 lymph node) Extended stage is spread beyond the lungs. Usually has early metastasis. May release ACTH, SIAD, Lambert eaton myasthenic syndrome. 

Adenocarcinoma
Mucin and TTF-1 Positive type of Lung Cancer. Graded from low grade to high grade. Bronchoalverolar carcionma is in situ carcinoma and has better prognosis. Most common in Non-Smokers (BAC)

Squamous Cell Lung Cancer
Irritation of bronchus causing metaplasia, then dysplasia, then carcinoma in situ and finally lung cancer. Also associated with Keratin pearls and cavitation from central necrosis. Goes into hilar nodes and gets late metastasis. Asymptomatic and can be deteetd with sputum cytology. 


Large Cell Lung Cancer
Lots of cytoplasm, unknown origin and is a waste basket column. Peripheral and has late metastasis and can use cancer. 

TREATMENT OF LUNG CANCER
Small Cell Lung Cancer metastasizes early on and therefore surgery is not an option. Cisplatin, Carboplatin and vincristin is also used. Responds very well to chemotherapy. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) to prevent brain metastasis. Surgery is possible if the tumor is very small and no metastsis

Non Small Cell Lung Cancer is not responsive to chemotherapy or radiotherapy so surgery is the only option.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8kqVbFQ0Yzo/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:19.934638

Cancer immunology is the study of interactions between the immune system and cancer cells (also called tumors or malignancies). It is a growing field of research that aims to discover innovative cancer immunotherapies to treat and retard progression of the disease. The immune response, including the recognition of cancer-specific antigens is of particular interest in the field as knowledge gained drives the development of new vaccines and antibody therapies. For instance in 2007, Ohtani published a paper finding tumour infiltrating lymphocytes to be quite significant in human colorectal cancer. The host was given a better chance at survival if the cancer tissue showed infiltration of inflammatory cells, in particular those prompting lymphocytic reactions. The results yielded suggest some extent of anti-tumour immunity is present in colorectal cancers in humans.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h6E2Kv-OzjM/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:20.134246

8K_SJ7Bi3yE,Stomp On Step 1,UCZf7Lytruc9Uh5ZCbMz1k8Q,1408929584.0,"Difference between Benign and Malignant, Dysplasia, poorly differentiate well differentiated","http://www.stomponstep1.com/dysplasia-difference-between-benign-and-malignant/

As we have already learned, hyperplasia is a normal cellular response to increased stress which results in an increased number of cells. Metaplasia is a normal cellular response to an abnormal circumstance where the cell is presented with a type of stress it is not equipped to handle which causes the tissue to change the type of cells present. Severe or prolonged hyperplasia or metaplasia can become dysplasia. Dysplasia is an abnormal change in the cells characteristics often resulting in the presence of immature cells. It is usually accompanied by loss of normal cell orientation, shape & size. 

Dysplasia is rated by the grading system, which gives a numerical value based on the tissue’s level of differentiation. Low grade dysplasias are well differentiated pre-cancers that present low risk and rarely form cancer. High grade dysplasia is a type of early cancer that has a high risk of becoming malignant.   High grade dysplasia has not yet spread and is isolated within the basement membrane. The key different between cancer and hyperplasia/metaplasia/low grade dysplasia is that cancer is irreversible. Cancerous cells cannot return to normal.

Cancer is when cells grow, divide, and differentiate in an unregulated fashion as a result of genetic and epigenetic defects. Causes of cancer are complex and only partially understood. This cancerous tissue grows faster than the surrounding normal tissue usually resulting in a mass. 

Cancers initially start as a single mutated cell. This cell then proliferates and result is an early mass of identical cells (clonal population). However, over time additional mutations occur due to genomic instability. This leads to a heterogeneous group of cells within the mass that have different abilities (such as invasion and metastasis). This is why most cancers take decades to form. A single mutation is usually not enough to cause metastatic cancer. Generally, many genetic and epigenetic changes must take place to convert a normal cell into a metastatic cancer. 
 

There are two types of cancers, benign and malignant. Generally speaking, malignant cancers are “really bad” and benign cancers are “not so bad.” The key difference between the two classifications is metastatic potential. Malignant cells have the ability to invade tissue and metastasize (spread to other sites) while benign tumors do not. However, malignant cancers don’t always invade and metastasize. 

Benign and malignant cancers look very different when viewed using a microscope. Benign tumors look very much like the normal tissue it was derived from. Malignant cancers on the other hand look very different than normal tissue and are easily identifiable from the surrounding tissue. This is because there are more genetic and epigenetic abnormalities in malignant cells (higher rate of mitosis & less regulatory control  genomic instability). These malignant cells no longer look like the mature cells in the surrounding tissue. The abnormalities have changed the cells into a more primitive cell type with a greater variety of characteristics. This is referred to as being Poorly Differentiated (AKA Anaplastic). DON’T confuse this with how easy it is to “differentiate” the cancer from the surrounding tissue, because poorly differentiated cancers are easy to find on a microscope. Benign cancers may only have a few defects present which mean they are still pretty similar to the normal cell the cancer originated from. These cells are similar to normal mature cells and therefore are Well Differentiated. 

Benign Cancer & Normal Tissue:
• Regular, organized pattern of cell shape and arrangement
• Neighboring cells look very similar
• Normal sized nuclei 
• Little mitosis

Malignant Cancer:
• Irregular, unorganized cell shape and arrangement
• Neighboring cells can look very different
• Big nuclei
• Lots of mitosis
• Hyper chromatic (darker color)

DNA Replication : https://youtu.be/ePZc-71PT_4


In cells with a nucleus, as in eukaryotes, the cell cycle is also divided into two main stages: interphase and the mitotic (M) phase (including mitosis and cytokinesis. During interphase, the cell grows, accumulating nutrients needed for mitosis, and undergoes DNA replication preparing it for cell division. During the mitotic phase, the replicated chromosomes and cytoplasm separate into two new daughter cells. To ensure the proper division of the cell, there are control mechanisms known as cell cycle checkpoints.

The cell-division cycle is a vital process by which a single-celled fertilized egg develops into a mature organism, as well as the process by which hair, skin, blood cells, and some internal organs are renewed. After cell division, each of the daughter cells begin the interphase of a new cycle. Although the various stages of interphase are not usually morphologically distinguishable, each phase of the cell cycle has a distinct set of specialized biochemical processes that prepare the cell for initiation of cell division.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P6cAYs-bijA/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-14 12:48:20.717050

xVsDbUaVXRI,Prostate Cancer Research Institute,UCPYrfTJMCTfhBNZxb31Z1tg,1565980615.0,Cancer Treatment: Why a Vegetarian Diet Helps,"PCRI's Executive Director, Dr. Mark Scholz, MD, gives three lines of evidence to argue that a vegetarian or vegan diet is ideal for men with prostate cancer hoping to achieve optimal outcomes.

0:30 There is one principle regarding diet for men with prostate cancer that overrides all others in its significance, and it is that vegetarian and vegan diets have better outcomes than diets that include meat and animal products.  It's difficult to change diets and so the purpose of the video is to provide information to help men have a solid foundation for understanding why a vegan or vegetarian diet can improve their situation.

0:53 In Dr. Scholz's own practice he has witnessed a number of cases in which men with rising PSAs choose to go on a strict vegan or vegetarian diet.  In cases where men lose weight (suggesting fidelity to the diet), he has consistently seen a cessation of PSA rise, a PSA drop, and then steady healthy PSA results.  

2:22 The second line of argument deals with the metabolic nature of prostate cancer.  Most people know that with most cancers it is important to avoid sugar.  PET scans have shown that most cancers metabolize sugars within minutes.  Prostate cancer, however, does not have that relationship with sugar.  Instead, new technology has found that prostate cancers metabolize fats (lipids) and proteins (amino acids) at the same fast pace that most cancers metabolize sugar.  These lipids and amino acids are the building blocks of animal tissues. 

4:06 The third argument comes from T. Colin Campbell's book ""The China Study.""  Campbell rigorously compared regions of China and found that areas with low consumption of animal products also had low incidences of cancer, including prostate cancer. 

4:56 Should all men with prostate cancer stop eating animal products?  It might be overboard for men with low-grade prostate cancers to make drastic lifestyle changes due to their cancer.  Men with advanced disease (Royal), however, definitely ought to consider cutting out animal products.

LpHrHy2kFYE,Prostate Cancer Research Institute,UCPYrfTJMCTfhBNZxb31Z1tg,1562076561.0,Why Prostate Cancer Survivor Steve Schwartz Thinks It’s Important to Be Vigilant,"PCRI's CEO, Alex Scholz, sits down with prostate cancer survivor Steve Schwartz to discuss his history of fighting prostate cancer.  His story is one that highlights the value of being a vigilant patient.  He researched all of his options, sought second opinions, and complied with lifestyle recommendations to achieve the best possible outcomes given a tough situation.

0:22 Mr. Schwartz's battle with prostate cancer began eight years ago when he and his doctors noticed that his PSA was rising.  He was sent to a urologist who performed a random biopsy, found a core of Gleason 3+4=7, and recommended radical prostatectomy. He decided to have a second opinion on his pathology slides to see if that was possible.  A second doctor graded his pathology slides as 3+3, seemingly making him a good candidate for active surveillance.  He had a third doctor, Dr. Jonathan Epstein, review his slides, and he too decided that the samples were pre-cancerous rather than cancerous, seemingly making him a good candidate for active surveillance. 

2:56 Mr. Schwartz then went to see a medical oncologist Dr. Mark Scholz who expressed concern with the accuracy of the random biopsy and suggested that Mr. Schwartz undergo imaging.  Dr. Scholz performed a color doppler ultrasound, found a suspicious area, and recommended an MRI-guided biopsy of the suspicious area.  The MRI-guided biopsy found cancer in all three samples, 80% involved, Gleason 4+4=8.  Mr. Schwartz sent the pathology slides to Dr. Epstein who confirmed that the samples were 4+4=8.

5:11 Since Mr. Schwartz's Gleason grade was found to 4+4=8, he knew that he was not a candidate for active surveillance.  He continued to research treatment options and spoke with his doctor about the possibility of partial-cryotherapy.  He underwent the procedure with Dr. Duke Bahn and experienced little to no side effects from the procedure. 

6:24 Mr. Schwartz went into remission for six or seven years until he noticed that his PSA was rising again.  He had color doppler and MRI imaging performed, but they were unable to detect anything within the prostate.  He went to see a doctor in Arizona who—at the time—had the most advanced imaging capabilities.  Initially, that doctor found two unusual spots in the pelvis but did not believe that they were cancerous.  Mr. Schwartz gave the doctor scans that he had done in the past, and the comparison helped convince the doctor that the spots actually were likely cancerous.  He had a second opinion done at UCLA who concurred that the two spots were likely cancerous. 

8:03 The status quo for treating prostate cancer metastases had been to go on androgen deprivation (first-generation, e.g. Lupron) indefinitely until you die.  However, the results from recent studies and successes from Dr. Scholz's practice convinced Mr. Schwartz that the best course of action was to be as aggressive and early with his treatment as possible.  He decided, in concert with his physicians, to go on Lupron, Zytiga (a second-generation hormone therapy), and chemotherapy (Taxotere) at the same time. 

10:40 Mr. Schwartz utilized an Ice Cap to preserve his hair during chemotherapy.  He also heeded Dr. Scholz's advice to do consistent weight training and exercise to counteract the side effects of fatigue.  Although it was difficult, he had a trainer who held him accountable. Because of his efforts, he only experienced mild side effects from this treatment protocol. 

14:15 In addition to the systemic therapies, Mr. Schwartz had SBRT (a form of radiation) directed at his metastases.

Pya8N78bR7s,Prostate Cancer Research Institute,UCPYrfTJMCTfhBNZxb31Z1tg,1561135072.0,Which is Better - Surgery vs. Radiation for Prostate Cancer?,"PCRI’s Executive Director, Mark Scholz, MD, explains why there has been a surgery vs. radiation controversy, describes the pertinent risks and considerations when deciding between the two treatments, and explains why he thinks radiation is usually going to be the preferable option, all things considered.

0:43 The main reason why there is a controversy about whether surgery or radiation is better for treating prostate cancer is that as recently as 10-15 years ago the technology for radiation was significantly less effective and more toxic than it is today.  There were also fewer options for salvage therapy after radiation in the event of a relapse.  Since then, radiation technology has advanced significantly, but the dialogue has been comparatively mired. Today, radiation can be precisely delivered, and radiation is achieving even better cure rates than surgery. 

1:59 Surgeons are constrained by the fact that the bladder and the rectum are within millimeters of the prostate.  They cannot cut a margin around the gland.  Radiation oncologists are not limited in this way. 

2:21 External beam radiation has a cure rate about as good as surgery, and radioactive seed implants have even better cure rates than surgery.

2:33 Most men will live for a very long time after being treated for prostate cancer, and so it is important to consider the side effects of each treatment, especially now that they all have comparable cure rates.

2:54 There is a risk of sexual dysfunction with both surgery and radiation, however, the rate of impotence after surgery is significantly higher than after radiation. 

3:15 There is a risk of incontinence with surgery that is almost non-existent with radiation.  An operation performed by a top surgeon on an ideal candidate has about a 5-10% risk of causing incontinence, and that is with the best possible conditions.  Stress incontinence occurs in around 50% of men, and ejaculation of urine occurs in about 20% of men.  

4:00 Rectum burns used to be a concerning side effect of radiation, but that risk has been eliminated with the advent of SpaceOAR, a gel that separates the prostate from the rectum and protects it from radiation.

0:10 Many people try to overinterpret the PSA test; however, it is a non-specific test that provides limited information.  To get the most out of the PSA test, one must know their prostate size to calculate the expected PSA and PSA density (that is to say, the PSA in relationship to the prostate size).  Learn more about PSA density here: https://bit.ly/2RdNQEs

1:19 If men have larger than average prostates and they do not know their prostate size, they are liable to unnecessary biopsies if a physician is looking at the raw PSA instead of calculating the PSA density based on a man's size. 

2:04 Prostate enlargement is oftentimes the result of other health issues (weight gain, elevated blood sugar, elevated blood pressure).  Diet and exercise should be the first consideration for prostate enlargement as well as a myriad of other health issues.

M5QBH3wDrQY,TEDx Talks,UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q,1416502714.0,My survival story -- what I learned from having cancer | Martin Inderbitzin | TEDxZurich,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Martin Inderbitzin was 32 years old, with a fresh PhD degree, a new job and about to start a new life when he was suddenly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

He had to go through surgery and endure nine months of radiochemotherapy. While coping with his new situation and challenging his many fears he realized how important his own state of mind was. In the middle of his treatment, when he was barely able to walk, he decided to sign up for a triathlon, despite never having seriously practiced endurance sports before. Today, he says this was one of the most important decisions of his life.

With this new goal in mind he quickly realized the positive effect it had on his mental and physiological state. He tried to figure out how to‚train‘, while still being under treatment. After he had left the hospital his energy slowly returned and his training became more serious. Three months after the end of his treatment, Martin crossed the finish line of his first triathlon. Today, Martin is an enthusiastic Amateur-Triathlete, competing regularly in races around the globe.

During his time as a patient Martin was inspired by stories from other patients who had lived through the same hassle. While crossing the finish line of his first race he realized that he himself had become an inspiration for other patients. This life changing moment gave Martin the idea to start his initiative: to collect and document cancer survival stories in the form of short videos and make them available to other patients and their families on an online platform.

Martin Inderbitzin studied biology at the ETH Zurich and did his PhD in Neuroscience at UPF Barcelona with a special focus on artificial emotions and human computer interaction. After his studies in Spain he moved back to his home town Zurich and started to work as an interaction designer. In 2012 his dreams of a successful career were destroyed by a cancer diagnosis. While in treatment he decided to become a triathlete despite never having practiced this sport before. Since he left the hospital in 2013 he has completed multiple races and is enjoying his health again.

Often times, solutions to the toughest questions in medicine can be found in nature. Dr. Carlo Maley, an evolutionary and cancer biologist, discusses how nature has already beaten cancer, and the possibility of using those methods in humans.  

Dr. Carlo Maley applies tools from evolutionary biology and ecology to tumors in order to understand and prevent the evolution of malignancy and therapeutic resistance.

While interested in all cancers, Dr. Maley currently works on Barrett’s esophagus, acute myeloid leukemia, lung cancer, and breast cancer. In this work, his team uses measures of the rate of evolution in the tumors to predict which patients will develop malignancy and succumb to their disease. He is also working on novel approaches to prevent the evolution of resistance and transform cancer from an acute disease to a chronic, non-lethal disease. His team is working on comparative oncology to discover how large long-lived organisms like whales and elephants are able to prevent cancer much more effectively than humans.

Dr Rangan Chatterjee thinks you can. Often referred to as the doctor of the future, Rangan is changing the way that we look at illness and how medicine will be practised in years to come. He highlighted his methods in the groundbreaking BBC TV show, Doctor In The House, gaining him much acclaim from patients, his contemporaries and the media.

He is the author of the international bestseller, The 4 Pillar Plan - http://amzn.to/2yGfpuB which has been released in the USA and Canada under the title, How to Make Disease Disappear - https://amzn.to/2GstJf6 Rangan’s 15 years of clinical experience in the NHS includes internal medicine, immunology and general practice. A pioneer in the emerging field of progressive medicine, he also uses techniques from other disciplines he has studied including movement kinetics and functional medicine.

His own journey of learning was accelerated when family members fell ill and now Rangan is helping people to take control of their health by addressing the root causes of their illnesses, something which is often not achieved in 21st century health care, evidenced by a steady increase in the rates of chronic disease.

Rangan is a super-generalist, looking at as many factors as possible which can create wellness or illness. His talk is testament to how our thinking around the concept of disease needs to change to help form a map for future healthcare.

Magnetism seems like a pretty magical phenomenon. Rocks that attract or repel each other at a distance - that's really cool - and electric current in a wire interacts in the same way. What's even more amazing is how it works. We normally think of special relativity as having little bearing on our lives because everything happens at such low speeds that relativistic effects are negligible. But when you consider the large number of charges in a wire and the strength of the electric interaction, you can see that electromagnets function thanks to the special relativistic effect of length contraction. In a frame of reference moving with the charges, there is an electric field that creates a force on the charges. But in the lab frame, there is no electric field so it must be a magnetic field creating the force. Hence we see that a magnetic field is what an electric field becomes when an electrically charged object starts moving.

It touches every one of us in one way or another. While the march goes on to find a cure, over 4600 people a day - in the US alone- are handed a cancer diagnosis. What if you or a loved one become a statistic? And what if you learned that there was something you could do- right now- to take back some control? Enter the ketogenic diet. The concept of food as medicine is nothing new. What’s different now is that cancer research has given us a deeper appreciation of the changes that drive cancer at the cellular level. This information gives each of us the opportunity to shape indifference to diet into a new paradigm for cancer treatment that extends beyond clinic walls Miriam Kalamian is a nutrition consultant, educator, and author specializing in the implementation of ketogenic therapies. She earned her master of education (EdM) from Smith College and her master of human nutrition (MS) from Eastern Michigan University.

After losing her own identity, she immersed herself in a personal silent treatment, found her own rhythm, and emerged with her first album. Listen as she performs original songs “Para Ti” and “El Circo.” Accompaniment by Courtney Isaiah Smith on keyboard, Alicia Wrigley on bass, and Parker Swenson on drums.

This presentation was filmed during the COVID-19 pandemic, with only a limited live audience of cast and crew members. While applause has been added to the beginning and end of the video, all other aspects have intentionally remained as filmed to honor the struggle and loss experienced globally during 2020. Jazmin “Jazzy” Olivo is a Dominican singer, songwriter, and actress who began her career at the age of 3. After winning numerous singing competitions in her native Dominican Republic, she moved to Utah at the age of 17 and trained with David Schmidt, current Head of Vocal Studies at the University of Utah. 

In 2005, Jazmin was awarded 6th place in La Academia USA, a musical reality show with Hispanic contestants. She toured the country for a year and then moved to Mexico City where she debuted on Broadway—cast as Motor Mouth Mable in Hairspray the Musical.

Since returning to Utah, Jazmin has performed with the Utah Symphony and different local bands. In 2017, Jazmin co-founded a jazz fusion band, The Mix, with Pianist Courtney Smith.

Jazzy is now embarking on her solo career with her single “Para Ti, “ the first release from her bilingual (Spanish/English) debut EP, releasing in 2020. Other songs from the album include Broken Bloody Heart, Me Repongo, Kidibum, and El Circo.

About Lissa Rankin, MD:
New age gurus suggest that we can heal ourselves by simply changing our minds, but is this concept grounded in cold, hard science? Lissa Rankin, MD explores the scientific literature, reviewing case studies of spontaneous remission, as well as placebo and nocebo effect data, to prove that our thoughts powerfully affect our physiology when we believe we can get well.

About TEDx:
In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.

In our society cancer is often associated with death. But this is a story about life. For her, cancer was literally a re-birth. Prior to the illness, she didn’t know how to grant herself unconditional love. Then the diagnosis and the realization that in every test lies an opportunity. The only condition is being willing to learn. 
Most of the time, attitude is a major indicator of how events will unfold. Reaction is instinctive but choice is the way out and we can choose the way we react. Through cancer Giulia learnt how to always look after herself first and how to use empathy. With the therapies over, however, she realized that there was yet another challenge to face: people assuming that she could just be her old self in a world that had all changed. Thus she made the decision to become the super brave warrior of her life. True peace can only come from the inside out, and this is as true for an illness as it is for any other challenge.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx  Giulia Muntoni has worked for the English Civil Service for nine years after completing her degree in Greek Archaeology. She recently returned to her native Italy after overcoming breast cancer in 2014, a true “watershed” moment in her life. Ever since, she has been talking, writing and publishing about her experience, giving voice to a passion for communication that had always inspired her to reach out to others with empathy. Her positive approach to life keeps motivating her to embark on new adventures, such as the TEDx talk, hoping to inspire her generation and the new ones to be proactive builders of their own world.  Amongst her many dreams, there is the desire to help raise awareness of cancer, and also the aspiration to become a motivational speaker.

BwVtIqNuhFc,LearnNeuroradiology,UC6RICkCkDRjxar5rdsVJStA,1530355464.0,Imaging intracranial hemorrhage - imaging appearance and evolution,"This section covers the general imaging appearance of intracranial hemorrhage.

On CT, acute hemorrhage is initially hyperdense due to high protein content within serum and red blood cells. Over time, proteinaceous contents will be cleared and the hemorrhage will become less dense.

The MRI appearance of hemorrhage is dominated by the status of hemoglobin. oxyhemoglobin is first converted to deoxyhemoglobin and then methemoglobin, all which have slightly different MR properties. It's complex, but there are stupid mnemonic devices you can use to help.

The level of this lecture is appropriate for medical students, junior residents, and trainees in other specialties who have an interest in neuroradiology or may see patients with intracranial hemorrhage or stroke.

The video is lead by Dr. Kathleen Poston. She is faculty at Stanford and a neurologist with an expertise in movement disorders. She is an active researcher in the field of Parkinson's Disease and an wonderful clinician. (The patient is this video, Larry, is a patient of Dr. Poston's.)

* All exams are demonstrated with examples of real abnormalities thanks to our amazing patients! Special thank you to Larry for being the primary patient in this video. Larry is an amazing teacher and person!

The four cardinal parts of the exam for Parkinson's Disease (covered in detail in this video) are:
1) Bradykinesia (required for diagnosis of 
2) Rigidity
3) Tremor (usually rest tremor but also kinetic and intentional tremor)
4) Issues with gait and postural instability

The Stanford Medicine 25 program for bedside medicine at the Stanford School of Medicine aims to promote the culture of bedside medicine to make current and future clinicians and other healthcare provides better at the art of physical diagnosis and more confident at the bedside of their patients.

Here we are, just a year after the first news of the coronavirus we now call SARS-CoV-2 and the global pandemic known as COVID-19… and scientists have already developed more than one safe & effective vaccine. How did they do that so quickly? I visited the lab whose work directly led to these first COVID vaccines, so you can learn how basic research connects to life-saving medicine. This is how to make a COVID-19 vaccine.

The YouTube star and former NASA engineer describes how this data-backed mindset for life gamification has stuck with him along his journey, and how it impacts the ways he helps (or tricks) his viewers into learning science, engineering, and design. Mark Rober has made a career out of engineering, entertainment, and education. After completing degrees in mechanical engineering from Brigham Young University and the University of Southern California, Rober joined NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 2004. In his nine years as a NASA engineer, seven of which were on the Mars rover Curiosity team, Rober worked on both the Descent Stage (the jet pack that lowered the Rover to the surface) and some hardware on the Rover top deck for collecting samples. In 2011, Rober’s iPad-based Halloween costume helped launch both his creative costume company, Digital Dudz, and his YouTube channel, which now boasts 3 million subscribers and 400 million views. His videos focus on creative ideas and science- and engineering-based pranks and activities. Rober is a regular guest on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"". Today, he does research and development work for a large technology company in Northern California, where he lives with his wife and son. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

The most common cause is over-tightness of the shoulder muscles which leads on to the development of tendinitis or bursitis.

In many cases shoulder pain can be overcome through stretching the shoulders with a strength band and using massage balls to reduce the tightness.

In this video Ashley discusses the anatomy of the shoulder including the muscles of the rotator cuff and touches on some of the issues that can arise.

Ashley then goes on to show you the tests that he finds most useful in screening shoulder pain followed by the stretches and massage ball techniques he finds most useful.

This video will hopefully be useful for those who suffer from chronic shoulder pain, tendinitis, bursitis, rotator cuff injuries or just want to simply increase their overall shoulder health.

k_D6KBId740,nabil ebraheim,UCOHfqHMhHvfQCYJDXfpSAiw,1482355067.0,Rotator Cuff tear  Imaging - Everything You Need To Know - Dr. Nabil Ebraheim,"Dr. Ebraheim’s educational animated video illustrates the shoulder rotator cuff muscles and types of imaging.

AP  view x-ray:
True AP (45° lateral)
Patient can be standing, sitting, or lying down.
Get a true AP view of the shoulder which will show the acromiohumeral interval which the normal interval should be between 7-14 mm.
The x-ray may show proximal migration of the humeral head which means there is a chronic rotator cuff tea.
Calcific tendonitis may also be seen on AP view x-ray.
Beam aimed with 10° caudal tilt.
Allows calcification of the acromion.
The supraspinatus outlet view will show the shape of the acromion.
OS acromial may be seen on axillary view x-ray.
MRI is the best study for diagnosing rotator cuff tears.
The MRI takes slices of cuts of the bone and the soft tissue structures as if you are taking a slice from an apple.
The slices of the MRI can be seen in either a coronal, sagittal, or axial orientation.
The normal rotator cuff appears dark on T1 and T2 on the MRI.
Arthrogram is not used routinely.
It is used when the patient is unable to have an MRI (pacemaker).
Similar to a patient with a pacemaker that cannot have an MRI done of the spine (myelogram is done).
Arthrogram will show the dye in the subacromial space.
If the “Geyser Signs” is present with the dye leaking into the subacromial space as well as the AC joint, then there is a huge tear.
If you add MRI to the arthrogram, that will increase the sensitivity and the specificity, and will show also any instability and partial tears better than arthrogram alone.
When it comes to the MRI: the T2 is probably the best in showing the tears.
The problem with MRI is the presence of asymptomatic cuff tear that are seen frequently in patients, especially older patients.
50% of asymptomatic patients 60 years or older will show rotator cuff tears on MRI.
These tears increase in frequency with age.
Rotator cuff tears and patient age is important because of a few points.
1- A lot of asymptomatic tears.
2- Patient is above the age of 40 years old with a dislocated shoulder may also have a rotator cuff tear.
3- Chronic tears are found in older patients which could involve multiple tendons.
4- The surgical outcome of rotator cuff repair depends on the age of the patient, the older the age of the patient, the worse the outcome.
5- Older patients with rotator cuff arthropathy can have reverse shoulder arthroplasty, which is different from younger patients.
When you look at the MRI, you want to know the type of tear (partial or complete), the size of the tear (small, medium, or large).
Rotator cuff tears are classified into either partial thickness or full thickness tears.
- Partial thickness tears are classified by location into three types:
• Articular –sided.
• Bursal sided.
• Intrasubstance.
These tears are also classified according to the size of the tear (greater or less than 50% thickness).
The fluid or dye will extend partially through the thickness of the tendon; however there is no retraction of the tendon.
Full thickness tears:
- Complete tear: the bright fluid signal extends completely through the tendon from superior to inferior.
You want to know how much retraction is involved with the rotator cuff tear.
Massive rotator cuff tears that are greater than 5 cm usually involve multiple tendons.
The tendon will be retracted to the level of the glenoid and there will be atrophy of the muscle with fatty infiltration and probably superior migration of the humeral head.
What is the quality of the muscle?
Check for the presence of fatty atrophy on the sagittal view MRI.
Normally the supraspinatus muscle occupies the fossa in the sagittal view.
When the muscle is atrophied or abnormal, it does not occupy the fossa completely.
Fatty muscle atrophy see on sagittal view usually means that there is either a chronic rotator cuff tear or suprascapular nerve injury.
0- Normal 
1- Some fatty streaks
2- More muscle than fat
3- Equal fat and muscle
4- More fat than muscle
It is important to know the proper orientation of the rotator cuff muscles in the sagittal view.
Look at the long head of the biceps in an axial view.
Check for subluxation of the biceps tendon which should mea there is also a tear of the subscapularis tendon.
Remember: the long head of the biceps is anteriorly located.
Look for cysts of the greater tuberosity on MRI which are seen in a lot of patients with rotator cuff tears.
CT Arthtogram:
- Done sometimes post operatively.
- When the patient has anchors, we cannot see them well.
- Some believe that ultrasound is better in these cases.
- Used with frequency and is not expensive.
- It may create dynamic evaluation.
- There is a learning curve for using ultrasound imaging and it cannot evaluate the shoulder joint itself.
- About 20% will show a rotator cuff tear in asymptomatic patients.

O3hZ5tscM00,nabil ebraheim,UCOHfqHMhHvfQCYJDXfpSAiw,1500468391.0,Rotator Cuff Muscles - Everything You Need To Know - Dr. Nabil Ebraheim,"Dr. Ebraheim's animated educational video describing muscles of the rotator cuff.
The rotator cuff is a group of four muscle; the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and the subscapularis . 

These four rotator cuff muscles all originate from the scapula and insert into the proximal humerus .

Supraspinatus
The supraspinatus muscle arises from the supraspinous fossa and is inserted into the superior facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus . The supraspinatus abducts the arm and stabilizes the humerus. A tear in the supraspinatus muscle will result in the inability to abduct the shoulder. 

The supraspinatus and the infraspinatus muscles are both supplied by the suprascapular nerve (C5, C6), which arises from the superior trunk of the brachial plexus.

When testing the supraspinatus muscle, a physician can perform the Neer Impingement Test, Hawkin’s Test or the Jobe’s Test. In the Jobe’s test, the supraspinatus muscle is tested with the shoulder abducted to 90°, flexed to 30°, and maximally internally rotated. Downward pressure is resisted primarily by the supraspinatus muscle. Jobe’s test is probably the best test for this muscle function. 

Infraspinatus
The infraspinatus muscle is a thick triangular muscle located on the posterior aspect of the scapula. It originates from the infraspinatus fossa and inserts into the middle facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus. The infraspinatus is the primary external rotator with the arm to the side and it also helps to stabilize the humerus. External rotation of the shoulder occurs in conjunction with the teres minor. 

The infraspinatus muscle and the supraspinatus muscles are supplied by the suprascapular nerve (C5,C6), which arises from the superior trunk of the brachial plexus . 
When there is a tear of the infraspinatus muscle, the patient will have dysfunction with external rotation of the arm. The infraspinatus muscle is usually evaluated by testing the external rotation of the shoulder with the arm to the side, it is testing the external rotation of the arm against resistance. During the external rotation lag test, the examiner passively rotates the arm into full external rotation. The test is positive when the examiner lets go of the arm and the patient is unable to maintain the position of full external rotation. 
Teres Minor
The teres minor originates at the lateral border and adjacent posterior surface of the scapula and it inserts at the greater tubercle of the humerus. The teres minor muscle is involved in external rotation of the arm along with the infraspinatus muscle (infraspinatus is the primary external rotator of the arm). 
The teres minor muscle is innervates by the posterior branch of the axillary nerve (posterior cord C5, C6) .
When testing the teres minor, the physician will conduct the Horn Blower’s Test. This tests the external rotation with the arm held in 90° of abduction . The test is positive if the arm falls into internal rotation.
Subscapularis
The subscapularis is a large triangular muscle, which fills the subscapular fossa and inserts into the lesser tubercle of the humerus and the front of the capsule of the shoulder joint (Figure 12).The subscapularis rotates the head of the humerus medially (internal rotation) and adducts the arm. It is the internal rotator of the arm. 
The subscapularis muscle is innervated by the upper and lower subscapular nerves (posterior cord C5, C6, C7).
The physician can test the subscapularis muscle by performing the Lift-off test. If the patient is unable to lift the hand off of the lower back, then a tear of the subscapularis tendon is suspected. The lift-off lag test is another test that may be utilized. The examiner will hold the patient’s hand away from the back at the lumbar region and let go. The patient will be unable to keep the hand away from the back if the tendon is torn. A third test that may be used is the belly-press test. The physician has the patient press the palm of the hand against the abdomen with the wrist in a neutral position, this is an example of an intact subscapularis tendon. A positive sign for the belly-press test occurs if the patient is unable to press his belly without wrist volar flexion or the elbow falling posteriorly.

A DNA microarray (also commonly known as DNA chip or biochip) is a collection of microscopic DNA spots attached to a solid surface. Scientists use DNA microarrays to measure the expression levels of large numbers of genes simultaneously or to genotype multiple regions of a genome. Each DNA spot contains picomoles (10−12 moles) of a specific DNA sequence, known as probes (or reporters or oligos). These can be a short section of a gene or other DNA element that are used to hybridize a cDNA or cRNA (also called anti-sense RNA) sample (called target) under high-stringency conditions. Probe-target hybridization is usually detected and quantified by detection of fluorophore-, silver-, or chemiluminescence-labeled targets to determine relative abundance of nucleic acid sequences in the target.

Proteomics is the large-scale study of proteins, particularly their structures and functions.[1][2] Proteins are vital parts of living organisms, as they are the main components of the physiological metabolic pathways of cells. The term proteomics was first coined in 1997[3] to make an analogy with genomics, the study of the genome. The word proteome is a blend of protein and genome, and was coined by Marc Wilkins in 1994 while working on the concept as a PhD student.[4][5]

The proteome is the entire set of proteins,[4] produced or modified by an organism or system. This varies with time and distinct requirements, or stresses, that a cell or organism undergoes. Proteomics is an interdisciplinary domain formed on the basis of the research and development of the Human Genome Project;[citation needed] it is also emerging scientific research and exploration of proteomes from the overall level of intracellular protein composition, structure, and its own unique activity patterns. It is an important component of functional genomics.

While proteomics generally refers to the large-scale experimental analysis of proteins, it is often specifically used for protein purification and mass spectrometry.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vnW9kH0agcE/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-15 14:10:09.205081

Fu7t3rjW7yQ,Shomu's Biology,UCEPMCywJ6FPZpQ_aPEZt5JA,1433145645.0,Gene regulation in eukaryotes,"Gene regulation in eukaryotes - This lecture explains about the eukaryotic gene regulation. Regulation of gene expression entails a vast variety of mechanisms which can be utilized by cells to expand or shrink the creation of particular gene products (protein or RNA), and is informally termed gene legislation. Subtle packages of gene expression are greatly found in biology, for illustration to set off developmental pathways, reply to environmental stimuli, or adapt to new food sources. Virtually any step of gene expression can also be modulated, from transcriptional initiation, to RNA processing, and to the post-translational change of a protein.

Gene regulation is main for viruses, prokaryotes and eukaryotes because it raises the flexibility and adaptability of an organism via permitting the cellphone to specific protein when needed. Although as early as 1951 Barbara McClintock confirmed interaction between two genetic loci, Activator (Ac) and Dissociator (Ds), in the color formation of maize seeds, the first discovery of a gene law approach is widely regarded to be the identification in 1961 of the lac operon, learned through Jacques Monod, in which some enzymes involved in lactose metabolism are expressed by using the genome of E. Coli handiest within the presence of lactose and absence of glucose.

Furthermore, in multicellular organisms, gene regulation drives the processes of cellular differentiation and morphogenesis, main to the creation of unique cellphone forms that possess different gene expression profiles, and therefore produce one of a kind proteins/have special ultrastructures that suit them to their capabilities (although they all possess the genotype, which follows the equal genome sequence).

The initiating event main to a transformation in gene expression include activation or deactivation of receptors. Additionally, there's proof that alterations in a mobile's option of catabolism results in altered gene expressions.

To interpret intercalating dye assays, users need to know how to analyze melt curves, and understand the benefits and limitations of melt curve analysis. In this presentation, Nick Downey, PhD, covers melt curve basics and shares examples of multiple peaks due to suboptimal sample prep, primer dimers, and asymmetric GC content of amplicons. He demonstrates troubleshooting strategies. Experienced and novice users will benefit from an overview of uMelt software, developed by the Wittwer lab at the University of Utah, that can predict the melt profile of your assay before you run your experiment.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qLAGD-Wy0D8/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-15 14:10:10.076070
uyvfijFiXjk,Thermo Fisher Scientific,UCfUs2fCDhx07fkszsJ0jOcA,1479922138.0,Using Standard Curve to Estimate DNA Quantity - Forensic Focus #4,"Submit your questions at http://www.thermofisher.com/forensicfocus

Everyone wants to know how much DNA is in their extract, but then they ask: how can I tell if my estimate is accurate?

The standard curve holds the answers.

A standard curve is a tool that allows us to estimate the DNA concentration of unknown samples by comparing them to standards with known DNA concentrations.

In this example, the standards consist of a 10-fold dilution series ranging from 50 ng/ul down to 5 pg/ul.

    During each PCR cycle, the amount of fluorescent signal for each standard in the dilution seies is measured. When the fluorescent signal crosses the detection threshold the cycle number is recorded as a Ct value, or threshold cycle value. The Ct value is what ultimately is used to create the standard curve.

    The Ct values are inversely proportional to the concentration of DNA in the standards. The high-concentration, 50 ng/ul standard will cross the detection threshold first, generating a “low” Ct. The low-concentration, 5 pg/ul standard will take many more cycles to cross the same threshold - and therefore the Ct will be higher.

    The Ct values for each dilution of the standard curve are plotted on a graph, and the software generates a regression line that fits the data.

    Because the standards are 10-fold dilutions, we expect the change in Ct from one standard to the next to be uniform. An uneven distribution of Ct values might indicate that the dilution series was not accurately pipetted.


Let’s take a look at the standard curve for a specific DNA target, the small autosomal target.

The X axis is the log of the known standard concentrations.  The Y axis is the Ct value of each standard.

Now, Do you see the quality metrics at the bottom of the screen?  Let’s review Slope, Y intercept, and R2.?

The slope measures the efficiency of the PCR reaction.  In a perfect world, a slope of -3.3 indicates that the PCR reaction is 100% efficient; the target DNA is doubled each cycle.  Two copies become four; four become eight; and so on.

The Y intercept is the expected Ct value for a 1ng/ul sample.

The R2 value measures how well the regression line fits the data points.  A line that fits the data points perfectly has an R2 of 1.  If your data points are scattered, the R2 value for the line will be lower.

The Ct values of your standards affect the slope, the Y intercept, and the R2 value.  It is very important to prepare the standard dilution series carefully to ensure consistent and accurate results!

Running the standards in duplicate can help ensure you have a high quality standard curve.

Once your standard curve passes the metrics test, it can be used to evaluate an unknown sample!

The Ct value of the unknown sample is measured, and compared to the standard curve to estimate the DNA concentration of the unknown sample.  Couldn’t be simpler!

In this video, Sr. Field Applications Specialist Doug Rains examines why the choice of an appropriate normalizer gene is so critical for the accuracy of final real-time PCR data. In addition to discussing this gene's importance, Doug provides a helpful reference document which explains in detail how researchers can quantitatively validate their choice of a control gene.
Relative gene expression is one of the most common applications that researchers perform on their real-time instruments. So it's never a surprise when I receive a question like the one I got recently from Shan at Pennsylvania State University, who asks the following:, ""Since every cDNA is run with both the gene of interest and internal control, do I have to be sure that the concentration of each  cDNA is the same? Excellent question. Let's start with a little bit of review.
Whenever we do a gene expression experiment, we need at least two gene-specific assays one for our gene of interest, and one for an internal control gene, also sometimes referred to as a ""normalizer,"" ""housekeeping gene,"" or ""endogenous control."" Different terms, same idea.
So what does this second gene -- the normalizer -- do for us? Essentially, its number one job is to normalize our final data for differing input amounts of template. Here's what I mean.
Say I'm comparing the expression of my gene of interest in two samples: an untreated and a treated cell line. When I examine the real-time results, I find that my two samples differ by a single Ct. This result suggests that there's a two-fold difference in my target's expression between the two samples. But how do I know that two-field difference is real?
After all, isn't it possible that my untreated and treated cDNAs had different concentrations, and that's the reason we're seeing a one-Ct difference? Definitely a possibility. Precisely why I also have to run a normalizer gene on each sample. 
A good normalizer gene is one whose expression is stable across my various sample types, assuming equal starting amounts. Thanks to the data I collect from this second gene assay, I can effectively monitor input amounts of cDNA, even when they differ from sample to sample. Then, at the end of the run, I can use Ct data from the normalizer gene to correct final expression values for differing input amounts of cDNA. I can thereby avoid having to always add equal amounts of template when running my experiments.
But clearly, for the normalizer to do its job correctly, its expression has to be stable across our sample set. If it's not, the data from the normalizer can actually make our final expression values less accurate. So how does one choose a good normalizer?
To find out, I strongly recommend our kind viewers visit the Life Technologies web page, where you can download a copy of the Relative Gene Expression Workflow document. This PDF has an entire section on choosing the most appropriate normalizer, based not on guesswork, but on good, hard empirical data.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jst-3hD_xFQ/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-15 14:10:10.076070

4QPyVcpbvNw,Thermo Fisher Scientific,UCfUs2fCDhx07fkszsJ0jOcA,1339442016.0,Finding Multiple Melt-Curve Peaks When Using SYBR® Green in Real-Time PCR  -- Ask TaqMan®: Ep. 8,"Submit your Real-Time PCR questions and watch the rest of our videos at http://ow.ly/bQh0l. Life Technologies Sr. Field Application Specialist Doug Rains helps with the understanding the causes of multiple peaks in a melt curve when using SYBR® Green dye in Real-Time PCR. SYBR® Green I chemistry is a free-floating dye. Here's how it works. When SYBR® Green dye is just swimming around in the tube, it doesn't give off much fluorescence -- even when we zap it with the light source on a real-time PCR machine. But SYBR® Green dye really likes to bind to double-stranded DNA. And, when it does, and you hit it with light, the dye gets excited and fluoresces.
In theory, the basic idea, then, is this: as PCR creates more and more product, the signal of SYBR® Green dye should go up proportionally. In practice, this doesn't always happen. That's because SYBR® Green dye binds to any double-stranded DNA. Meaning, every double-stranded molecule in the tube will bind SYBR® Green dye and add to the fluorescent signal. Because of this concern, users run melt curves after each experiment. They do this by slowly raising the block temperature from about 60 degrees Celsius up to 95 degrees Celsius and monitoring fluorescence. As you can see, signal drops slowly until at some point, it drops off suddenly to zero. Halfway down this drop-off is the presumed melting temperature of the product created during PCR.
If you have the software do a little calculus for you, you get what's called the derivative view, which I find a little more helpful, since the drop-off gets converted into a peak. What you're hoping to see is one, clearly defined peak, which suggests— doesn't prove, mind you— but suggests that you got clean amplification of a single product. One thing you don't want to see is multiple peaks, as this suggests your amplification curves are a composite of more than one product. So what causes extraneous peaks? It really depends. It could be non-specific amplification or primer-dimer formation. In the first case, you'll need to redesign your primers to a more specific sequence. In the latter case, you may just need to lower the concentration of primer to discourage dimer formation, although a primer redesign may ultimately be necessary.
The problem is, it's difficult to know exactly what's causing certain anomalies, so some users end up spending a lot of time repeating failed experiments under multiple new conditions or with multiple new primer sets. That's neither fun nor affordable. Still, SYBR® chemistry is perfectly valid for qPCR when all things go well. Users just need to take more care than users of TaqMan® chemistry do in designing their experiments, and take additional quality control steps when evaluating their data.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4QPyVcpbvNw/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-15 14:10:10.548920
fkUDu042xic,Thermo Fisher Scientific,UCfUs2fCDhx07fkszsJ0jOcA,1361849831.0,How TaqMan Works -- Ask TaqMan® Ep. 13 by Life Technologies,"Submit your real-time PCR questions at http://www.lifetechnologies.com/asktaqman
Just how does TaqMan work?  Sr. Field Applications Specialist Doug Rains explores the specific mechanism by which TaqMan® achieves its unparalleled specificity and sensitivity. Around the world, researchers rely on TaqMan® for gene expression, SNP gentoyping , protein expression, pathogen detection and quantification, and more.
For many years, TaqMan has been the gold-standard chemistry for real-time PCR. It's famed for its unparalleled specificity, sensitivity, and ease of use. So it's not surprising that users want to know what Shrikant at ICL College in India asked recently: namely, ""How does TaqMan work?"" I'm glad you asked.
Just like any PCR, TaqMan-based reactions require a double-stranded template, as well as two fairly standard, target-specific primers. But unlike those used in regular PCR, TaqMan Assays require a third, sequence-specific oligo called a probe. TaqMan probes are quite different from the primers in two ways. First, they can't be extended by our friendly enzyme, Taq Polymerase, since they lack a free hydroxyl group.
What's more, TaqMan probes are covalently joined to two other molecules. On the 5'-end, there's a fluorescent molecule known as the reporter -- called that because it reports signal to us as we generate more and more product. On the 3'-end is a molecule known as the quencher, which quenches the fluorescent signal from the reporter under certain circumstances. Let's see what those circumstances are.
Here we're looking at an intact probe, with the reporter in green, the quencher in red. Normally, when we zap the probe with light, we expect the reporter to get excited and fluoresce. But because the quencher is in close proximity to the reporter, instead what happens is, the energy gets transferred from reporter to quencher.  The transfer of energy is known as FRET, or Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer. The important thing to note here is that, as long as the probe remains intact, there is no permanent increase in fluorescent signal from the reporter.
However, if the reporter and quencher are permanently separated during the reaction, and then light strikes the reaction, the Reporter does in fact fluoresce, producing signal the instrument can detect. 
The basic idea, then, is this: each time we create a new PCR amplicon, we want to permanently split the reporter and quencher. By doing so, florescence will always increase proportionally with product, allowing us to effectively monitor what's happening to our reactions throughout the run. Here it is in action.
We begin our reactions (CLICK) by denaturing our template at a high temperature. As we lower the temperature, our probe and primers bind. Taq now comes in, finds the primers, and begins the extension phase of PCR by creating new complementary strands of DNA. But wait a second: there's a probe sitting in the way. It's a showdown in the making! What will the polymerase do? Stop in its tracks? Turn back in fear? Nay, friends, not Taq Polymerase. You see, our enzyme has what's referred to as ""exonuclease activity."" Meaning? It pretty much eats DNA for lunch.
So when Taq reaches the probe, it simply chews it to bits on its way to creating new amplicon. As a result, the reporter and quencher are physically separated, creating a permanent increase in fluorescence that, not coincidentally, perfectly accords with our doubling of product.
And, of course, that our real-time instrument can monitor and record this increase in fluorescence after each cycle, generating an amplification plot that's more than a little useful for interpreting our data.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fkUDu042xic/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-15 14:10:10.548920
iJlglRFGjpw,Thermo Fisher Scientific,UCfUs2fCDhx07fkszsJ0jOcA,1339441718.0,How to Measure PCR Efficiency of an Assay -- Ask TaqMan®: Ep. 4,"Submit your Real-Time PCR questions and watch the rest of our videos at http://ow.ly/bQh0l. Life Technologies Sr. Field Application Specialist Doug Rains helps with the understanding of PCR efficiency and how to properly measure it in your assays. To check the efficiency of an assay, you need to run a template dilution curve in real-time, and then look at the resulting slope of that curve.
That slope value -- assuming you prepare the curve properly -- tells you the efficiency. If the slope is a -3.3, then the assay is amplifying at or very near 100% -- exactly what we want in real-time PCR. But if that value is more negative -- say, -3.7 -- then the efficiency will be less than 100%. There's actually a formula into which you can plug this slope and get your numerical efficiency.
Happily, with all newer AB instrument software, the efficiency calculation is actually done for you. Just go to Results  Standard Curve, and there it is. Now, here's the thing: I see a lot of cases where people make mistakes preparing their dilution curves, and as a result, calculate incorrect efficiencies. So what I want to do is give you TEN . . . suggestions on how to improve the accuracy of your dilution curves.
#10: Use well-calibrated pipettemen
#9: Serially dilute standard material
#8: For AQ, always use an appropriate standard material
#7: Mix standards thoroughly after each dilution
#6: Pipette higher volumes for better precision
#5: Run ≥ triplicates of each dilution point in real-time

QkLJLl6h0uw,Thermo Fisher Scientific,UCfUs2fCDhx07fkszsJ0jOcA,1469477330.0,How to Optimize qPCR using SYBR Green Assays - Ask TaqMan #38,"Learn More: http://www.thermofisher.com/sybr

Are you new to using SYBR Green Assays for qPCR or having trouble getting accurate results? Today, let’s discuss how you can design and optimize qPCR using SYBR Green assays as the detection method.
First, beware of reverse transcription (RT) bias when converting RNA to cDNA.  Nearly all RT enzymes have the potential to introduce RT bias.  When this happens the amount of cDNA won’t align with the amount in RNA samples.  Learn More about RT Methods in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-8OuXFFJz0 
You can test for RT bias by reverse transcribing two-fold dilutions of a known amount of RNA.  Then run a qPCR standard curve for each assay and endogenous control. The standard cure should be linear with a target slope of -3.323.”  
Once the cDNA is generated make sure to use the right primers for the qPCR.
You will need to use some bioinformatics to design your primers, such as a tool like SNPMasker.  

In general, primers should be 20 nucleotides in length with a GC content in the 30-70% range. The last 5 nucleotides at the 3’ end should include no more than two G or C bases to avoid specificity issues. Finally, amplicons should be short -- generally between 50 – 150 base pairs.
The next step is primer validation.  The objective is to find the right concentration of forward and reverse primers that will yield the most robust assay without non-specific amplification or primer dimers.  
This is accomplished by running multiple qPCRs with 3 different concentrations of forward and reverse primers in a matrix format. The appropriate range of primer concentration is determined by the master mix.

For instance, Applied Biosystems PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix works best with primer concentrations in the range of 300 – 800 nM. 

Getting back to our experiments to optimize primer concentrations, the next step is to evaluate the Ct and run a melting curve also known as a dissociation curve for each primer concentration combination.

If dissociation curve shows primer-dimers, there are two options:
A. Start over and redesign the primers.
B. Alter cycling temperatures to remove primer-dimers.  
The last step in ensuring that your primer set is going to yield usable, reproducible data is to ensure the PCR efficiency is within 90 – 110%. You can do this by simply running a standard curve with at least 5 logs of input DNA and using the software on your instrument to calculate PCR efficiency.

If this all seems too complicated, you can use pre-designed TaqMan assays instead, which removes the primer design variable and ensures the best possible primer set 
Once the primers are designed, experimental analysis can begin.

Here’s a tip! For measuring relative gene expression levels of two different samples, most researchers use what’s known as the ΔΔCt (ddCt) method. This analysis generates relative changes form one state to the next, much like a disease state versus treatments

Submit your real-time PCR questions at http://www.lifetechnologies.com/asktaqman
In this video, examine whether or not qPCR end-users doing gene expression should dilute cDNA prior to running samples. This video also looks at the possible need to dilute RNA prior to reverse transcription.  This takes into consideration a host of scenarios including final reaction volume, expression level of genes under study.
It's true that a large percentage of gene expression researchers dilute their cDNA prior to running reactions. Some do a 1:3 dilution, others say 1:5 is better, while at least a few individuals insist that a 1:10 is best. Playing devil's advocate are a whole host of researchers who will gladly inform you that diluting cDNA at all is a waste of time and perfectly good, reagent-grade H2O!
So who's right and who's . . . not? Well, like so many things in life and science, it depends. To see what I mean, let's talk for just a second about the top reasons why some people choose to dilute cDNA.
First concern: high-concentration cDNA might have a negative effect on PCR, especially if it contains inhibitors carried over from the initial RNA isolation step. Mmm . . . yes and no. It's true that inhibitors can have an impact on PCR. But cDNA tends to be fairly dilute, and so inhibiting compounds are rarely introduced into PCR at sufficient quantities to cause problems.
That said, if the original RNA sample is really dirty, or contains lots of residual chemicals from the RNA prep such as Ethanol, it's likely that the reverse transcription step itself won't be successful. So failed real-time reactions? Often not caused by cDNA being dirty, but rather to an unsuccessful RT that produced little or no cDNA in the first place! That's why RNA should always be squeaky clean.
I should mention: reverse transcription buffers can inhibit PCR, especially if added to reactions at greater than 20% of the final volume. So If you aren't diluting cDNA, don't add more than, say, 5 uL of the RT reaction to a 25 ul reaction.
There is a second reason people dilute cDNA: the fear that too much cDNA will cause the housekeeping gene -- especially if it's a very high expresser like 18s -- to appear so early during cycling that an accurate baseline can't be set
I agree, this is a real concern, and probably a good reason for diluting. Just be sure not to dilute so much that your target gene Cts drift into the mid-30s or later, since this can causes problems of its own. One final note: users always have the option of limiting how much RNA goes into the initial RT reaction.
To help you determine how much RNA you should use, please visit LifeTechnologies.com and download a copy of the Relative Gene Expression Workflow Guide. Step 9 contains step-by-step instructions on how to empirically ensure that you're using an appropriate amount of template. This document also covers most other aspects of gene expression experiments.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k6ViikIp1Yg/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-15 14:10:11.059487

Life Technologies Sr. Field Application Specialist Doug Rains offers advices for fixing common software set-up mistakes when performing Real-Time PCR. I'm showing you a completed run file. Let's say I made a lot more mistakes than you did while setting up my file: wrong sample names, wrong dyes, and, yes, even forgot to label some wells. As you can see, I'm in Analysis under the Experiment Menu. To fix things, I'm going to go up here and click Setup. In the Plate Setup window, you can see my list of targets and samples. If I originally entered information incorrectly, I can change it right here. Let's say it's something as simple as a sample name. I activate the offending box, type the new name, and hit Enter. I now go to my plate map, which I access by clicking this tab, and I find that the new sample name has been added to the appropriate wells automatically.
Okay, let's go back to Define Targets and Samples. Now what if I assigned the wrong fluorescent label to one of my assays? This one says FAM, but it should say VIC. That mistake left unfixed will definitely cause some analysis issues. However, I can just use the Reporter pull-down menu and make the switch. When I now go back to Analysis and click the analyze button, my change gets applied. And of course, the data improve dramatically.
How is this possible? It's possible because whenever the instrument takes readings, it does so through every filter set, regardless of your dye assignment. Thus, the raw data are always there in the file. Back to Setup, where we'll deal with the issue of missing well assignments. Row D is blank because somebody forgot to assign assays and samples. And so these wells yield no data. But if I simply make the assignments now like so then go back to Analysis and reanalyzed the data, curves for those wells will appear. So, what information can we change after the fact? Just about anything besides cycling conditions. That includes sample and Assay names, Tasks (such as which wells are standards), standard amounts, the passive reference dye, and plenty more. Not only that, every Life Technologies real-time PCR instrument gives you this leeway. So even if you're using an older instrument, that's okay. In fact, you can even change the experiment type on all of the newer Life Technologies platforms, So if you accidentally labeled your ddCt run as a standard curve experiment, you can change that.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gYTR7HgWNNo/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-15 14:10:11.059487

Life Technologies Sr. Field Application Specialist Doug Rains helps with the understanding of thresholds in Real-Time PCR. The threshold is a horizontal line in our amplification plot that can be moved up or down on the Y-axis. Its purpose? As we'll see in a minute, it tells the software where to take data. Of course, not all places on the Y-axis are equal. Some places we want to avoid. Specifically, we don't want to be too low, otherwise we get down into the noise. Conversely, if we go too high, we're in the linear or plateau phase of amplification, where data are less predictable. A happy spot? Some place where all of our curves are straight and parallel to one another.
What we really want is to put the threshold wherever the precision of our replicates is highest. That's generally somewhere toward the middle of the geometric phase, or maybe slightly higher. In any case, with a really robust assay, hitting a bad spot is quite difficult. The default on all Applied Biosystems® real-time PCR software is Auto Threshold, meaning, the software sets thresholds for us the second we click Analyze. Notice that it sets a different threshold for each assay separately, which is good since not all assays have the same sweet spot. I could go switch any one or all of my thresholds to Manual mode, then move the line up or down with my mouse.
Once the threshold is set and we click analyze, all the samples get their respective Ct values. Now, the attentive viewer might be tempted to ask: if the threshold can be moved up or down, doesn't that change the Cts? The answer is, ""Yes."" But here's the thing: as long as we keep the threshold firmly within the geometric phase, the relative, or delta Ct between any two samples stays constant. This fact allows us to do things like calculate fold changes in expression from sample to sample, and to get quantity information from a standard curve.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H_xsuRQIM9M/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-15 14:10:11.059487
T8Ovs6OC4KE,Thermo Fisher Scientific,UCfUs2fCDhx07fkszsJ0jOcA,1393625928.0,Over 100% Assay Efficiency in qPCR? Not so fast. -- Ask TaqMan #21,"Submit your question: http://bit.ly/1cgFftk
In another Ask TaqMan video, we discussed assay efficiency and how to calculate it. But how does efficiency really impact our experiments, or as Julie Kase at George Washington University asks, why is it important? Does the efficiency for all of my targets have to be the same? The aim for all assays is to be 100% efficient, which means there is an exact doubling of your template every cycle.  

We previously found that this can be calculated thru a dilution series and the following equation. In order to use the ΔΔCT  method for relative quantitation, the efficiency of the target and endogenous control must be approximately equal -- meaning that the assay efficiency should be within 10% of each other, so 100% +/- 10%.  If the range is greater than 10%, then you need to be aware that when you evaluate fold changes, the unequal PCR efficiencies will correlate to a decrease in the accuracy of the calculated fold change.  

Keep in mind that Life Technologies has well over one million pre-developed Assays, which have been in-silico validated to be up to 100% efficient, so the efficiency calculation is not necessary. However, If you do check, and find the efficiency is outside of the acceptable range, then there is likely something from the sample or setup that is throwing things off.

So what happens if my efficiency is say, 150%?  Your first thought might be, ""Wow, my assay rocks!  That's good, right?""  Well, actually no.  It is not possible to be over 100% efficient, so something else is going on here.  Let's review some causes of high or low efficiency, and how to fix them.  

First, let's take a look at what's going on with efficiency over 100%. The most common cause of efficiencies greater than 100% are inhibitors.  This can be carryover from the sample itself such as heparin or humic acids.  Or another source could be contaminants from the RNA or DNA isolation such as SDS or phenol.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T8Ovs6OC4KE/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-15 14:10:11.059487

Now let's run our Taqman array card. So as you see these cards are stable at room temperature. They ship that way and you can store them that way.

And here's how the product looks when it first comes out of the box. Something of note, all the tacqman cards are bar coded with both the part number and the lot number.
I will now open up the card.

And, here is the card.I'll pop it out.

Comes with a little desiccator and you can see now this is what the taqman array card looks like. We have up here 8 different ports and each of these ports corresponds to 48 different wells. In each of these different wells is a dried down taqman assay.

The fill ports have two different holes. One is to fill, the other is an air port. So, this is a very simple procedure. You fill up each of these 8 ports. You've pipetted 8 different times and now you're going to be interrogating 384 different spots. Depending on the format of the card would depend on how many samples and how many genes you can look at. So, now we're ready to load the card and it's really quite simple.
Each of the different ports is labeled 1 thru 8 so I have the one closest to me. And the pipette-men is set to 100 micro-liters because that's the amount I'm going to put into each of the ports. And I'll also bring in my sample, which is just here.

And now I'm ready to load the card. So, what I will do is go into the larger of the fill ports. Add in the pipette tip and pipette my sample.

Finished. And now I will go into the next fill port, which is pour number two.

Add in the pipettemen. Pipette my sample. Done, it's as easy as that.

And there we go, all 8 ports are filled and we're ready to take it to the next step. The liquid now once it's centrifuged, will go down this little port and it will fill in all 48 wells for each of the different 8 ports. So, the way that we do this
Is, we bring in our centrifuge holder. So now let me take this out. I'll move the cart so you can see this. It's very easy. We say this side out.

We then place the card into here. [sound]. And then simply centrifuge it so that the liquid fills in all the different holes. Okay, now we're back from the centrifuge, and I will remove my card.

And you can see that the liquid is here towards the bottom of the fill port. The rest of the liquid, which is a sample of the master mix, is now down into the card.

And now we're ready to seal the card. I'll bring in the sealing device.

Here you can see it here. What I will do now, is add the card upside down.

There's only one way the card can fit, and now I'm going to push forward. And the card is sealed. We'll remove it from here.

Now I'm going to cut off the top. Where the fill ports were. Done, we're ready to run the card on the Viia 7.""",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DsKDWVLMvuc/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-15 14:10:11.306526

Life Technologies Sr. Field Application Specialist Doug Rains helps with the understanding of the different phases Real-Time PCR and why they're important. PCR does in fact have phases. But it's normally difficult to see PCR's phases in action. That said, once we do real-time PCR, we can easily visualize its phases. Fortunately, real-time is where PCR phases really matter. When we first start our reactions, there's a molar excess of all the reagents needed for amplification. As a result, we typically get a nice doubling of product with each cycle. In an amplification plot set to log scale, we see that exponential increase in product manifests itself as a straight line. This phase is known variously as the geometric, log, or exponential phase. Unfortunately, this doubling doesn't go on forever. At some point, the reagents in the tube— primers, dNTPs, and so on— start to run low. As a result, the reaction slows down. We call this the linear phase.
Finally, after some point, assuming the plate is run for enough cycles, the reactions run out of some critical ingredient. As a result, the reactions come to a halt. We call this the plateau phase. So why do we care? Because only one phase yields high-quality quantitative data: namely? You guessed it— the geometric phase. To see why, let's look at an example file.
In this run, I took a highly concentrated sample and serially diluted in 10-fold increments over 7 logs. I also ran eight technical replicates for each dilution point. What I want you to notice is this: in the geometric phase, which is approximately the area inside the box, all of my dilutions are very evenly spaced, exactly as I would expect. Also, my pipetting replicates are very tight, meaning I have excellent precision. But as we move into the later cycles—the so-called linear phase— that predictability starts to go away. My nice, straight lines begin to curve, messing up my even spacing. And my precision drops off considerably. Finally, in the later or plateau cycles, my data all merge together. The point is we always want to look at our data in the geometric phase, since this is where we'll get the best results, especially for a quantitative reaction. How do we do that? By making sure that's where the threshold is set.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4sXPUbIrh3A/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-15 14:10:11.572036

Get some helpful hints for Real-Time PCR assay design. It's a common question Life Technologies gets from people who've done a lot of gel-based PCR over the years and designed hundreds of primer sets, but never for real-time PCR. You might be asking yourself ""Do I need to do anything special?"" First off, size definitely matters when it comes to amplicons in real-time PCR. Be sure not to make your products too large, as this can contribute to a less-than-optimal PCR efficiency.  Instead, try to keep them somewhere between 50 and 150 bases long.
Second -- and this is critical for quantitative experiments -- don't design oligos to a mismatch or to a known polymorphic site, as this will cause inefficient binding during the first few PCR cycles and shift Cts to the right. Instead, always confirm that you have the correct sequence. Third -- be careful about designing to sequences that aren't unique. Be especially mindful of homologues, which often differ very little, if at all, in certain regions, and will therefore cause erroneous signal.
Try to always design at least one oligo to a region that's unique enough so that your assay won't give unwanted signal. Finally, you never want to design oligos to low-complexity sequence, including repetitive regions that certainly won't be unique in your genome or transcriptome.
There are lots of ways to get assays that fulfil all the criteria I mentioned. One way, of course, is to do all the bioinformatics work yourself on the context sequence, then use a program such as Primer Express Software to do the assay design. You then just order individual oligos. One of the really nice things about Primer Express Software is that it designs every set of oligos to work at Universal Cycling Conditions, meaning you never have to optimize real-time PCR conditions. Speaking of convenience, you should know about 2 other handy options for getting high-quality TaqMan® Assays: by either having Life Technologies design them for you through one of their Custom services, or by purchasing a pre-designed Assay. In either case, you can spare yourself the trouble of doing bioinformatics, your assays will all work at Universal Conditions, and they'll amplify with 100% efficiency— all of which should make you very happy. If you want to try out a pre-developed TaqMan® Assay for gene expression, we have excellent coverage for lots and lots of species. We even have pre-developed TaqMan® Assays for other applications, including SNP genotyping, microRNA and other small RNAs, copy number assays, and lots more.
And don't worry -- if we don't have your assay already, we can always custom design it for you.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cWGyy9n1cTQ/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-15 14:10:11.572036

At the end of the day you want to be able to write up your results and know the changes you see are real -- and not the result of handling or pipeting error. This prompted our next question from Anessh Chandran from the Rajiv Gandhi center for biotechnology, who asked ""What is the best method to ensure reliable and reproducible data?

Let's begin with our experimental plan. For instance, how many replicates do we really need to do? No one wants to use up any more reagents than necessary.  To keep reagents at a minimum, while still being able to catch any errors in pipeting, we recommend running triplicates. Let's look at an example to show why.

Here is a set of replicates for our target.  The Ct values are 20, 19, and 37. Hmm...looks like maybe I forgot to add sample to this well.  But that is not a problem.  With triplicates, we can clearly say that the Ct value of 37 is an outlier and should be removed.  I simply click to omit, update my data by clicking Analyze again, and viola! I can move on and still use this data point for the sample.  But let's look at another example, what if I only ran duplicates?  Now I have two samples with Cts of 22 and 31. Hmm..that's a lot of variation in a replicate.  I don't really want to average them, but I don't have any justification to use one over the other either.  Now I am forced to omit the entire sample from my data 

So, now we've seen why triplicates are a good practice, but do note that there are cases in which replicates would not be required -- such as large screening projects.  In these studies, many targets are tested at once to find significant hits, and those targets are later validated with more scrutiny... and more replicates!

So how do we ensure that our triplicates are tight?  Ideally the deviation among replicates is less than 0.5 Ct.  Let's go through some recommendations on the best practices for tight replicates:.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eIaPGhOjBQo/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-15 14:10:12.071865
bsYQowakt0E,Thermo Fisher Scientific,UCfUs2fCDhx07fkszsJ0jOcA,1436280630.0,Finding The Right MicroRNA (miRNA) Assays - Ask TaqMan #31,"Ask your question at https://www.thermofisher.com/ask

Are you working with microRNA, and are you having trouble measuring them due to their small size?  
Today, we are going to talk about the different microRNA assays available, and which is the right one for your application. 

MicroRNAs are small and around 22 nucleotide noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression. Due to their small size, the measurement of miRNAs presents some special challenges. miRNAs cannot use the same RT chemistry as other RNAs and require a special strategy to ensure specificity. Also, there are many miRNAs families that are highly homologous and differ by only a single base, highlighting the need for miRNA assays that are highly specific. 
To overcome these challenges, we offer two different types of microRNA assays that use the TaqMan chemistry: the TaqMan miRNA assays and the TaqMan Advanced miRNA assays.
First, let’s start with the TaqMan miRNA assays. These assays are based on an individual stem-loop RT primer and a sequence- specific TaqMan® assay to accurately detect mature miRNAs. 
1. After isolating total RNA, using a method that preserves small RNAs, the stem loop primer is added to the sample. Each stem loop primer binds specifically to an individual mature miRNA target. During reverse transcription, only the target mature miRNA is converted to cDNA, ensuring that this miRNA is the only one that will proceed to qPCR.
2. If desired, for low expressing miRNAs or samples that limited, we recommend the usage of a miRNA-specific preamplification step (or pre-Amp). This pre-Amp step will amplify the number of targets in the sample prior to qPCR and allow for quantitation of smaller input starting amounts. However, this step is optional. 
3. During qPCR, the TaqMan® MGB probe anneals specifically to a complementary sequence between the forward and reverse primer sites. 
The DNA polymerase cleaves only probes that are hybridized to the target. Cleavage separates the reporter dye from the quencher dye, resulting in increased fluorescence by the reporter. The increase in fluorescence signal occurs only if the target sequence is complementary to the probe and is amplified during PCR, so that nonspecific amplification is not detected. 

Next, let’s move on to the newest miRNA chemistry, the TaqMan Advanced miRNA assays. The TaqMan Advanced miRNA chemistry is based on a universal RT that will generate cDNA for all of the miRNA targets in the starting sample.
1. After isolation of total RNA, using a method that preserves small RNAs, Poly A polymerase is used to add a polyAdenosine tail on the 3’ end of all of the miRNAs in the sample.
2. In the next step, an oligonucleotide adaptor is ligated to the 5’ end of each of the miRNAs. Note that this reaction is dependent on the presence of a 5’ phosphate, which is only present on mature miRNAs. Any exogenous controls or spike-ins must also have this 5’ phosphate in order to be accurately quantitated. 
3.  A Universal RT primer binds to the polyA tail of the miRNA to reverse transcribe the RNA into cDNA. This universal RT step will convert all of the mature miRNAs in the sample to cDNA. 
4. Universal amplification (miR-Amp): universal forward and reverse primers amplify the cDNA for all miRNA targets in the sample. The miR-Amp step improves quantification of low expressing miRNAs and miRNAs collected from dilute samples such as body fluids. 
5. miRNA- specific primers and TaqMan probe are used to quantitate each miRNA of interest using individual qPCR assays. Note that these assays work specifically with TaqMan Advanced miRNA and cannot be used with the original TaqMan miRNA chemistry. 
To summarize, the TaqMan microRNA assays use a micro-RNA-specific RT primers and as such are best for looking at 1-10 targets. There are TaqMan microRNA assays for 205 species, aligned to the latest version of miRbase.  The TaqMan Advanced microRNA assays use a universal reverse transcription approach, making these assays better for situations where you are interrogating more than 10 targets.  These assays are primarily focused on human microRNAs.
If you’ve got more qPCR or digital PCR questions, remember, just ask Taqman.

7rfXC21y0Hc,Integrated DNA Technologies,UCsFLf2QSSP2iajVFK35WF-g,1541537721.0,Increasing genome editing efficiency and specificity with optimized CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs,"Use of CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionized targeted genome editing. The process requires the Cas9 enzyme and guide RNA (gRNA), which directs Cas9 to the target DNA location. The gRNA can be generated in various forms using different methods: gRNA can be expressed from a plasmid as a single guide RNA (sgRNA), transcribed in vitro as an sgRNA (IVT sgRNAs), or chemically synthesized as an sgRNA or two-part complex (crRNA duplexed with tracrRNA). Chemically synthesized gRNAs can be modified to enhance editing efficiency by stabilizing the gRNA against nuclease degradation, and also by reducing the risk of an innate immune response often seen with IVT sgRNAs.

In this webinar, Ashley Jacobi compares the on-target and off-target editing events observed with different gRNA formats in transformed and primary cell lines. She provides guidelines on when to use each gRNA in the context of your Cas9 source (plasmid, mRNA, ribonucleoprotein complex) and cell type.

The foundation of this product is IDT’s RNase H2 amplification technology. Upon hybridization of the primers to their specific target site, the RNase H2 enzyme cleaves the primer upstream of the RNA base. The cleavable, blocked primers are ideal for applications requiring large, multiplexed, PCR primer panels to help reduce the formation of primer dimers. Applications for this technology include detection of genetic markers in agricultural samples, detection of mutational hot spots relevant to oncology, and evaluation of on- and off-target genomic editing by CRISPR-Cas9. Custom rhAmpSeq Panels can be designed for any organism with a known genome.

mcOwlFVEino,Addgene,UCFS_3MJQzUr2H4_5km59xOQ,1596044356.0,How to Design Primers for PCR,"Are you looking to design a primer for your PCR? Jennifer Tsang, Science Communication and Marketing Coordinator at Addgene, is here with some tips for creating successful primers. For the full text protocol, visit https://www.addgene.org/protocols/primer-design/

Oligonucleotide primers are necessary when running a PCR reaction. One needs to design primers that are complementary to the template region of DNA. They are synthesized chemically by joining nucleotides together. One must selectively block and unblock repeatedly the reactive groups on a nucleotide when adding a nucleotide one at a time. The main property of primers is that they must correspond to sequences on the template molecule (must be complementary to template strand). However, primers do not need to correspond to the template strand completely; it is essential, however, that the 3’ end of the primer corresponds completely to the template DNA strand so elongation can proceed. Usually a guanine or cytosine is used at the 3’ end, and the 5’ end of the primer usually has stretches of several nucleotides. Also, both of the 3’ ends of the hybridized primers must point toward one another.

CRISPR-Cas9 has increased the accessibility of genome engineering due to its ease of use and ability to cause double strand breaks (DSBs) at almost any locus of interest. DSBs are repaired in cells by two predominant pathways: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR). Endogenous repair of DSBs using the NHEJ pathway typically results in functional protein disruption (knockout) whereas the HDR pathway can be used to introduce exogenous genetic content (knockin). During this webinar we will focus on the utility of a synthetic dual RNA approach to apply CRISPR-Cas9 to HDR genomic engineering applications and will provide guidelines for improving CRISPR Cas9-assisted HDR. We will also discuss the use of short single-stranded DNA as a donor template for small insertions as well as plasmid DNA donor templates for large insertions.

It has been widely reported that the wild-type A.s. Cas12a enzyme lacks the potency and site-to-site reliability of S.p. Cas9 when used to edit the human genome. Despite this shortcoming, A.s. Cas12a is an attractive option for genome editing due to its AT-rich PAM sequence, high fidelity, and its native reliance on a single short RNA guide. In this webinar, IDT staff scientist Dr Chris Vakulskas will talk about the development of a mutant protein, Alt-R A.s. Cas12a Ultra nuclease, which has dramatically improved cleavage activity that rivals S.p. Cas9 without altering its PAM  specificity. The A.s. Cas12a Ultra protein  also  demonstrates low-temperature  cleavage  activity superior to that of L.b. Cas12a, making it a universal Cas12a solution for genome editing in both animal and plant species. Finally, IDT research scientist Bernice Thommandru will describe optimal HDR methods and reagents for maximizing HDR rates when using either A.s. Cas12a Ultra or S.p. Cas9.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/epTngKifO38/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-15 14:10:12.935655

xrZMYVDcjZI,Doctor Mike,UC0QHWhjbe5fGJEPz3sVb6nw,1517701910.0,Doctor Mike On Diets: Intermittent Fasting | Diet Review,"Hey guys!  I've seen over and over questions and comments regarding dieting so I decided to start a series where I conduct a diet review in detail. I know many of you want to lose weight and there are many videos on weight loss out there. But I want to give you an honest doctor's take on fasting or time restricted eating. 

I kicked off the series with the very popular, intermittent fasting or time-restricted eating. It's claim to fame is that helps burn belly fat/ lose your belly and it does so through fast weight loss. But is fast weight loss even healthy? 

Anyway, I could go into more detail covering the smallest intricacies of the diet but I did not want to weigh down the video, both literally and figuratively. Please let me know if this is too little, too much, or just the right amount of information about intermittent fasting. 

Also, I want you to remember that diets are not all about weight loss but more importantly about eating healthy. I sincerely hope you enjoy, and definitely let me know if you want more videos like this by giving it a like and a share.

For the full story, visit: https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/10/07/jennifer-doudna-wins-2020-nobel-prize-in-chemistry/

University of California, Berkeley, biochemist Jennifer Doudna today won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, sharing it with colleague Emmanuelle Charpentier for the co-development of CRISPR-Cas9, a genome editing breakthrough that has revolutionized biomedicine.

CRISPR-Cas9 allows scientists to rewrite DNA — the code of life — in any organism, including human cells, with unprecedented efficiency and precision. The groundbreaking power and versatility of CRISPR-Cas9 has opened up new and wide-ranging possibilities across biology, agriculture and medicine, including the treatment of thousands of intractable diseases.

Doudna and Charpentier, director of the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, will share the 10 million Swedish krona (more than $1 million) prize.

“This great honor recognizes the history of CRISPR and the collaborative story of harnessing it into a profoundly powerful engineering technology that gives new hope and possibility to our society,” said Doudna. “What started as a curiosity‐driven, fundamental discovery project has now become the breakthrough strategy used by countless researchers working to help improve the human condition. I encourage continued support of fundamental science as well as public discourse about the ethical uses and responsible regulation of CRISPR technology.”

Liu shares a breakthrough: his lab's development of base editors that can rewrite DNA. This crucial step in genome editing takes the promise of CRISPR to the next level: if CRISPR proteins are molecular scissors, programmed to cut specific DNA sequences, then base editors are pencils, capable of directly rewriting one DNA letter into another.

And if this could be done in a fast, cheap and very accurate way, perhaps using our phone, then the future of medicine could be really revolutionised. In her young career, Janice Chen, a recent PhD graduate in Molecular and Cell Biology from the University of California, Berkeley, has co-created DETECTR, a programmable DNA detection technology based on the CRISPR gene editing tool. The new diagnostic tools developed by Chen and her colleagues could help us identify bacterial and viral infections, detect cancerous mutations as they happen, and recognise new outbreaks before they spread out. But they also trigger some ethical questions regarding data ownership and diagnostic counseling. Should we be able to diagnose diseases without physician oversight? We need to make decisions now as the technology is already available. Janice Chen did her graduate studies under CRISPR pioneer Jennifer Doudna. After her PhD at UCL, she went on to become the co-founder and Chief Research Officer at Mammoth Biosciences, a biotechnology company harnessing the CRISPR technology to create a rapid and

A quantum computer works in a totally different way from a classical computer. Quantum bits or 'qubits' can exist in a superposition state of both zero and one simultaneously. This means that a set of two qubits can be in a superposition of four states, which therefore require four numbers to uniquely identify the state. So the amount of information stored in N qubits is two to the power of N classical bits.

OVERVIEW:

In a profoundly informative and deeply optimistic discussion, Professor Michio Kaku delivers a glimpse of where science will take us in the next hundred years, as warp drives, teleportation, inter-dimensional wormholes, and even time travel converge with our scientific understanding of physical reality. While firing up our imaginations about the future, he also presents a succinct history of physics to the present.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
MICHIO KAKU:

Dr. Michio Kaku is the co-founder of string field theory, and is one of the most widely recognized scientists in the world today. He has written 4 New York Times Best Sellers, is the science correspondent for CBS This Morning and has hosted numerous science specials for BBC-TV, the Discovery/Science Channel. His radio show broadcasts to 100 radio stations every week. Dr. Kaku holds the Henry Semat Chair and Professorship in theoretical physics at the City College of New York (CUNY), where he has taught for over 25 years. He has also been a visiting professor at the Institute for Advanced Study as well as New York University (NYU).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRANSCRIPT:

My name is Professor Michio Kaku.  I’m a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York and I specialize in something called string theory.  I’m a physicist.
Some people ask me the question, “What has physics done for me lately?  I mean, do I get better color television, do I get better internet reception with physics?”  And the answer is yes.  You see, physics is at the very foundation of matter and energy.  We physicists invented the laser beam, we invented the transistor.  We helped to create the first computer.  We helped to construct the internet.  We wrote the World Wide Web.  In addition, we also helped to invent television, radio, radar, microwaves, not to mention MRI scans, PET scans, x-rays.  In other words, almost everything you see in your living room, almost everything you see in a modern hospital, at some point or other, can be traced to a physicist.

Now, I got interested in physics when I was a child.  When I was a child of eight, something happened to me that changed my life and I wanted to be part of this grand search for a theory of everything.  When I was eight, a great scientist had just died.  I still remember my elementary school teacher coming into the...

3D gravity animation courtesy of: https://1ucasvb.tumblr.com/ When Albert Einstein first published the Special Theory of relativity in 1905, he was  ridiculed. People thought it was just too weird and radical to be real. Einstein wasn’t satisfied with his theory either, because the theory did not apply if Gravity was present or if the observer was accelerating. One day, while observing a window washer on a ladder near his patent office, he had a thought experiments.

He imagined what would happen if the worker were to fall. He put himself in the window washer’s perspective, and imagined  what he would experience as he was falling. He realized that if he was falling, gravity would be the only force acting on him. He would be accelerating towards the ground, but since the ground would not be pushing up on his body, he would feel no weight. And this would be no different than being weightless in space. 

In a way gravity and acceleration were different ways to describe the same thing. The way to connect gravity in the theory of relativity was through the idea of acceleration, and this became the basis of general relativity. 

Einstein imagined being in a room with no windows, and a bathroom scale. It would weigh 80 Kgs, What if the room was  on a space ship accelerating in an upward direction at 9.8 m/s/s. He would feel the same weight. There would be no difference

He imagined what would happen if he took a flashlight and pointed it from one side of the room to the other, as the space ship was accelerating upwards. If he had a ruler, he could measure the height of the light on the other side of the room. He realized that the height measured on the wall would be lower than the source of the light, because the floor of the room would be rushing upwards at ever faster speeds, as the light was propagating across the room. The light beam would appear to curve downward. 

However, If you were on earth, and you measured the two heights, you may think that there should be no difference. That light should go straight to the other side of the room. Einstein thought it can’t be because it would violate the principle of equivalence. Acceleration of the room on a space should be no different than the room under the influence of gravity on earth. He realized that this meant light must bend in the presence of a gravitational field.

But light should be going on the shortest path. Then he realized, maybe the shortest path between two points is not a straight line but a curved line near gravity. 

This was the key insight that Einstein had about gravity. But in order to express this mathematically, it required very complicated mathematics that even a genius like Einstein could not easily figure out. He contacted an old buddy from his college days, mathematician Marcel Grossman.

It’s important to note that the trampoline analogy you normally see on TV shows and youtube videos like this is a 2D plane used for visualization purposes only, but it is really in 3D.  

In order for this theory to really be taken seriously, it had to make a prediction that could be tested, which was confirmed by the fact that it explained Mercury’s orbit which had been a mystery for decades because it had a precession. General relativity predicted exactly the precession that Mercury actually has. 

But many skeptics still remained. The most fool proof confirmation  came 4 years after he published it,when a team led English Astronomer, Arthur Eddington. in 1919, photographed stars near the sun during a total solar eclipse. He found that light passed near the sun was bent by the curvature of space due to its gravity.  This is the moment Einstein became a celebrity. 
#generalrelativity
#einstein
Why is this not just a distortion of space but also of time?...because special relativity says that light always moves at the same speed regardless of perspective or reference frame.  This means that light will have the same speed in an accelerating reference frame as it will in a resting reference frame.  But since the distance traveled by the beam of light in a gravitational field is longer due the curving of space, in order for the speed of light to remain constant, time itself must pass slower in the gravitational field relative to time in empty space. 

You should know that although General relativity is an amazing achievement, it does not answer everything. Questions remain. Although it tells us how gravity works, it doesn’t really tell us what exactly it is.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tzQC3uYL67U/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-15 14:10:16.418486

DuFyGHgGIKg,Insider,UCHJuQZuzapBh-CuhRYxIZrg,1556884450.0,Physicist Breaks Down The Science Of 10 Iconic Marvel Scenes | How Real Is It?,"To celebrate the release of “Avengers: Endgame,” we had physicist (and lifelong comic book fan) Jim Kakalios take a closer look at the physics of the Marvel universe. Here he reacts to 10 memorable scenes from Marvel movies and rates them based on their accuracy. Find out what exactly quantum mechanics, time dilation, Einstein’s theory of special relativity, and spider silk tell us about the superheroes of the Marvel franchise.

Which weapon would you rather have in a fight: Thor’s Mjolnir hammer or Captain America’s shield? Hint: The answer has to do with the conservation of energy — and the sonoluminescence of vibranium. Dr. Kakalios breaks down the physics behind this and many other Marvel phenomena, including Shuri’s holographic car in “Black Panther;”  Peter Parker’s spider-webbing train save in “Spider-Man 2;” the multiverse theory of “Doctor Strange;” the role of Pym particles and the Higgs boson in “Ant-Man;” artificial gravity in “Guardians of the Galaxy;” and Tony Stark’s cybernetic helmet and gold-titanium exoskeleton in “Iron Man.” He sheds light on why Carol Danvers doesn’t age from “Captain Marvel” to “Avengers: Endgame;” why the Space Stone is so powerful when yielded by Thanos in “Avengers: Infinity War;” and what’s with all the talk of quantum entanglement, quantum tunneling, and “quantum mumbo-jumbo” in “Ant-Man and the Wasp.”

Kakalios is the author of three books — “The Physics of Superheroes,” “The Physics of Everyday Things,” and “The Amazing Story of Quantum Mechanics.” He was a science consultant for Sony’s 2012 film “The Amazing Spider-Man.” Before that, he won an Emmy for his work as a science consultant for the Warner Bros. superhero film “Watchmen.” A physics professor at the University of Minnesota, Kakalios teaches a popular class that uses comic books to illustrate the principles of physics.

David Marquet rated the realism of submarine scenes in popular movies, judging their technological accuracy as well as the depiction of life on board.

Marquet addresses the realism of nuclear crisis movies, such as ""The World Is Not Enough"" and ""K-19: The Widowmaker,"". He also rated the accuracy of standoff scenes in ""The Hunt for Red October,"" ""The Enemy Below"", ""Hunter Killer,"" and ""Crimson Tide."" He also breaks down the realism of costumes, tactics, and terminology from ""U-571.""

Is life on board a submarine, including confined conditions and drills, as depicted in ""Das Boot""? Would Navy SEALs enter a submarine from a HALO drop similar to ""Act of Valor"", and is it possible for a submarine to hear music from the water's surface, like in  ""The Wolf's Call""? Can holes on a submarine be plugged with pins and other metal objects, as we see in ""The Simpsons""? Would nuclear missiles be triggered by dislodging in a ship interior, such as in ""Aquaman""?

Marquet graduated top of his class from the US Naval Academy and served for 28 years on submarines, including as an engineer officer aboard the USS Will Rogers, then as captain on the USS Olympia and the USS Santa Fe. Having retired in 2009, he is now a Wall Street Journal best-selling author of ""Turn the Ship Around! A True Story of Turning Followers Into Leaders.""

Davies addresses land mines in the TV show ""SEAL Team"" (2018) and other improvised explosive devices in ""The Hurt Locker"" (2008), ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" (1995), and ""Bodyguard"" (2018). 
He breaks down the ""red wire, blue wire"" movie device from ""Juggernaut"" (1974) and ""Blown Away"" (1994). 

Would nuclear devices have countdown timers as seen in ""Mission: Impossible – Fallout"" (2018)? Does sarin gas release the way it's shown in ""The Rock"" (1996)? And would a bathtub protect you from an explosion such as in ""Lethal Weapon 2"" (1989)? 

Davies led specialist teams in Iraq and Afghanistan as one of the British Army's leading bomb-disposal and weapons-intelligence experts. As an advanced IEDD operator, he also trained deployable EOD teams and served as the principal bomb-disposal operator within the UK's premier counterterrorism unit. He was the military advisor to the Ministry of Defence's Special Projects Search and Countermeasures delivery team and remains an internationally recognized authority on CT bomb disposal and defense robotics.

If you’ve ever seen an orchestra perform you’ve probably had a difficult time looking away from the person dead center on the stage – the conductor. It’s hard to miss someone as they swing their arms around pointing at the musicians that seem to be focused instead on their music stands. So what exactly is the conductor doing? 

We decided to ask James Gaffigan – a conductor who recently guest conducted the New York Philharmonic in Central Park – just what it is that makes a conductor so necessary and how their actions shape the performance.

VRtTz7w_iDY,Insider,UCHJuQZuzapBh-CuhRYxIZrg,1605799443.0,Pro Acting Coach Breaks Down 12 Batman Villain Performances | Good & Bad Acting,"Batman has arguably the best rogues' gallery of any comic-book universe. Hollywood has had its fair share of hits and misses in translating his arch-rivals to the screen. In this episode of ""Good & Bad Acting,"" LA acting coach Anthony Gilardi reacts to 12 of the most iconic live-action Batman villains, reviewing the highs and lows of the actors' performances.

From Adam West's campy 1960s TV series to Christopher Nolan's ""Dark Knight"" trilogy, the timeless appeal of the Batman universe has always been tied in with a colorful array of madmen and criminals. These include one of the most famous villains in comic-book history, the Joker, along with a stacked lineup of equally memorable adversaries, like Catwoman and the Penguin.

So, how does an actor put their own spin on a supervillain as beloved as these — and in a pantheon that includes the likes of Jack Nicholson, Eartha Kitt, and Heath Ledger? Gilardi breaks that down for us as he watches and critiques four Jokers, two Catwomen, a Riddler, a Penguin, a Scarecrow, and more.

When it comes to building a villain's mythos, many actors make use of what Gilardi calls ""shtick"" — a character's unique set of mannerisms and quirks, which add another unsettling layer to their presence in any scene. Gilardi looks at how different actors developed their signature Batman villain tics, from Heath Ledger's lip-smacking to Eartha Kitt's Catwoman purr. He breaks down how Kitt used her famous voice and eyes to play up Catwoman's feline nature in the ""Batman"" TV show; how Tom Hardy nailed the Bane voice in ""The Dark Knight Rises""; and how Margot Robbie gave Harley Quinn a singsong cadence in ""Suicide Squad."" Gilardo also evaluates cases where actors were less successful with their shtick, from Uma Thurman's take on Poison Ivy in the much maligned ""Batman & Robin"" to Jared Leto's panned turn as the Joker in 2016's ""Suicide Squad.""

But the best villains are much more than a bundle of creepy affectations and maniacal laughter; they're well-rounded characters, portrayed with complexity and moral ambiguity on screen. Gilardi explains how an actor like Jack Nicholson or Joaquin Phoenix channels their character's backstory into their actions and mannerisms — and how some of the more divisive performances, like Jim Carrey's Riddler or Danny DeVito's Penguin, tend to fall short in this dimension. Beyond character history, Gilardi looks at how actors establish complex motivation for their villain and convey what makes their characters tick. In ""Batman Begins,"" for example, he examines how Cillian Murphy developed a specific set of behavioral triggers for Dr. Jonathan Crane, the mad scientist known to his victims as the Scarecrow. And in ""The Dark Knight,"" he analyzes how Heath Ledger expressed the nihilism of the Joker through all the minutiae of his performance. Everything, from Ledger's gait, posture, and vocal inflection to the way he slaps on his Joker makeup, expresses the forces of chaos that drive the Clown Prince of Crime.

Gilardi emphasizes the importance of locating the humanity in each of Batman's famous foes, no matter how depraved their actions may be. As a case study, Gilardi evaluates Jack Nicholson's legendary turn as the Joker in 1989's ""Batman"" — a performance that captures what Gilardi calls ""liberated madness,"" which ultimately serves to humanize the Caped Crusader's main nemesis. He also examines how Joaquin Phoenix's character study in the 2019 standalone film ""Joker"" adds a sympathetic side to the Clown Prince's origins. In particular, Gilardi breaks down the genius of the bathroom scene, an improvised dance that marks the beginning of Arthur Fleck's transformation into antihero.

Senior video correspondent Graham Flanagan spent three days inside the James J. Rowley Training Center in Laurel, Maryland, where he observed recruits at various stages of training.

According to the Secret Service, about one in every 100 applicants makes it through the agency's intense vetting process to become a recruit. The base salary for new agents and officers is $47,000 per year.

After spending three months at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in either Artesia, New Mexico or Glynco, Georgia, recruits return to Laurel for three more months of Secret Service-specific training.

Although we were allowed to film inside the academy, much of the training remained secret. According to the training center's deputy chief, Michael Buck, this was intended to avoid ""giving people specifics into our protective methodologies ... we don't advertise our playbook.""

UPDATE: In the video, we identify a car as a Dodge Challenger, when what is seen on screen is a Dodge Charger.  We regret the error.

TFgS-dEITHQ,Insider,UCHJuQZuzapBh-CuhRYxIZrg,1602608043.0,Physicist Breaks Down The Science Of 11 DC Superhero Scenes | How Real Is It?,"Jim Kakalios takes a closer look at the physics of the DC universe. Here, he reacts to 11 memorable scenes from DC movies and rates them based on their accuracy. 

Kakalios addresses physical feats of DC superheroes, such as Joker in ""Suicide Squad"" jumping from an extreme height into a shallow vat of acid and Harley Quinn in ""Birds of Prey"" skating behind an automobile at high speed. He looks at the realism of superheroes' incredible skills, such as Aquaman's ability to sonically communicate with sharks and other fish. Would Shazam be able to charge up a mobile phone by shooting bolts of lightning at it? What material would Wonder Woman's bracelets need to be in order to deflect bullets?

Superman and Batman come under scrutiny in the video. Kakalios looks at Bruce Wayne's cape's rigidity in ""Batman Begins"" and whether it would allow Batman to fly across Gotham City. Would Superman be able to turn back time by flying around the world? Why can't he see through lead in ""Man of Steel""? And finally, what are the odds that both Batman and Superman have mothers named Martha? Kakalios calculates the odds from ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice."" 

Kakalios is the author of three books, ""The Physics of Superheroes,"" ""The Physics of Everyday Things,"" and ""The Amazing Story of Quantum Mechanics."" He also worked as a science consultant for the Warner Bros. film ""Watchmen"" and won a regional Emmy for the video ""Science of Watchmen."" A physics professor at the University of Minnesota, Kakalios teaches a popular class that uses comic books to illustrate the principles of physics.

CxU8IjbCyeE,Insider,UCHJuQZuzapBh-CuhRYxIZrg,1603807590.0,Physicist Rates 11 'Fast And Furious' Movie Stunts | How Real Is It?,"Diandra Leslie-Pelecky takes a closer look at the physics of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise. Here she reacts to 11 memorable scenes from the popular movie series and rates them based on their accuracy. 

Leslie-Pelecky addresses physical feats of the ""Fast and Furious"" crew, including stunts by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) and Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham). The franchise is known for its mind-bending physical feats utilizing cars, boats, trucks, tanks, planes, and even a submarine. 

Could you launch a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro onto the deck of a boat? Can you roll a 1987 Buick Grand National under an oil tanker? Can you use a bank vault as a catapult? Could a multimillion-dollar sports car jump from one skyscraper to another? Would a 2012 Dodge Charger SRT-8 be able to smash through the nose of an airplane? And could someone flex so hard that they break a plaster cast? Leslie-Pelecky breaks down the science behind some of the franchise's most iconic scenes. 

Leslie-Pelecky is a motorsports writer and blogger and the author of ""The Physics of NASCAR."" Her blog, Building Speed, focuses on the science of motorsports. She was an associate professor of physics at the University of Nebraska and received her PhD from the University of Michigan.

DmKU44ZeuRQ,Insider,UCHJuQZuzapBh-CuhRYxIZrg,1586201368.0,Archaeologist Breaks Down 10 Treasure Hunting Scenes In Movies | How Real Is It?,"Archaeology has played a role in scores of iconic Hollywood films, from “The Mummy” to “Titanic.” But what’s a real-life archaeologist’s take on these movies? New York University archaeologist Mariana Castro reacts to 10 scenes featuring the most famous fictional archaeologists and treasure hunters, from Indiana Jones to Lara Croft, and rates them based on their realism.

Find out how realistic Indiana Jones’ adventures are in movies like “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.” Watch Mariana dissect Nicolas Cage’s methodology in “National Treasure,” Angelina Jolie’s field gear in “Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,” Max von Sydow’s’s Iraq excavation in “The Exorcist,” and Rachel Weisz’s exhumation of the sarcophagus in “The Mummy.” She breaks down the important differences between excavation and looting, does some myth-busting about the pseudoarchaeology depicted in movies like “Stargate,” critiques Matthew McConaughey’s archaeological practices in “Sahara,” and tells us what Disney’s “Atlantis: The Lost Empire” actually gets right about archaeology.

From an expert’s perspective, find out whether archaeologists really use metal detectors, why the military does sometimes get involved in archaeological projects, why alien and space archaeology isn’t a thing, and why actual fieldwork doesn’t look like the shipwreck exploration seen in James Cameron’s “Titanic.” Plus, why booby traps aren’t all that common archaeology finds, and what tricks ancient civilizations actually used to deter looters.

_0RTH57v66I,Business Insider,UCcyq283he07B7_KUX07mmtA,1572378990.0,What New Marine Corps Recruits Go Through In Boot Camp,"We got an inside look at the United States Marine Corps’ intense 13-week basic training program. Senior video correspondent Graham Flanagan spent five days at the Marine Corps Recruit Training Depot in Parris Island, South Carolina, where he observed different companies at various stages of training.

Recruits endure a series of intense physical challenges such as entering a gas chamber, rappelling down a 47-foot-tower, and fighting each other with “pugil sticks.” The Marine Corps is the only US military branch that separates male and female recruits during basic training. In a statement to Business Insider, a spokesperson from the Marine Corps Recruit Training Depot at Parris Island said, “The same gender platoon model allows for appropriate acclimation to the training environment, development of key relationships with drill instructors, and optimal focus during the beginning of their transformation.”

After weeks of extreme physical and psychological challenges, training culminates with “The Crucible,” a 54-hour event where recruits endure exhausting combat scenarios while running on minimal food and sleep.

Senior video correspondent Graham Flanagan spent five days at the RCMP Academy, Depot Division in Regina, Saskatchewan where he observed different troops at various stages of training. The training is focused on mastering police procedure, but cadets are also put through intense physical challenges, such as entering a gas chamber and enduring a “uniform run” with a dog handler in sub-zero temperatures. Male and female cadets train together at Depot, and even square off against each other in Police Defensive Tactics training. The future Mounties also learn about RCMP customs and traditions dating back to the 19th century, culminating with the Regimental Dinner — a ceremony that, according to the RCMP, media had not been allowed to attend before this film shoot.

Editor's note: In the video, we incorrectly identify Yukon and Nunavut as Canadian provinces, when they are in fact classified as territories. We regret the error.

Webb takes a closer look at spinal injuries in movies and rates them for the character's chance of survival. Webb addresses physical injuries from falls at a height, such as Keanu Reeves' parachute fall in ""Point Break"" (1991) and building fall in ""John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum"" (2019). He looks at car-crash injuries, such as in ""Doctor Strange"" (2016), ""Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues"" (2013) and ""Bleed for This"" (2016).Would Leonardo DiCaprio have survived the bear attack in ""The Revenant"" (2015)? And would Christian Bale's spine have been fixed without surgery in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012)? Do real-life injuries sound just like Hilary Swank's neck hitting the boxing stool in ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004)? Webb breaks down some of cinema's most iconic scenes. Dr. Antonio J. Webb is a fellowship-trained spine surgeon, having completed a combined neurosurgery and orthopedic spine surgery fellowship at Texas Back Institute. He spent eight years in the US Air Force as a medic and licensed vocational nurse, including a deployment north of Baghdad in 2005. He practices in San Antonio, Texas.

767UcLMZTbo,Business Insider,UCcyq283he07B7_KUX07mmtA,1570717158.0,Why Japanese Swords Are So Expensive | So Expensive,"Japanese sword-making is a tradition that goes back centuries, and one that’s carried on to this day. Each sword takes dedication, skill and can take over 18 months to create. The resulting blades can be worth thousands of dollars. So what makes them so expensive?

Becoming a swordsmith in Japan takes a 5-year apprenticeship, and there are only around 180 working smiths today. Master Akihira has been making these swords for 21 years at his studio just outside of Tokyo, Japan.

Japanese swords have always been more than just weapons, they were artworks, status symbols, and throughout history had a huge spiritual importance. 

Each sword is a unique artwork and one that is made to be admired as you would a painting. As sheets of steel are folded into each other again and again wood grain-like patterns form, and these patterns coupled with the skill of the swordmaster create a completely unique blade. 

Knowing what to look for in each sword is important, characteristics like the angle of the blade and the way the metal is folded could give away the era in which it was made, and even who made it. Every small detail is treated as equally important. 

Looking at the months of work that go into creating each blade, it's easy to see why these swords command such a high price. And as there are less and less sword masters across Japan, these works of art are only going to become more valuable.

9oHUYu4Itt4,Random Hands,UCrI3dm4qgAEV67Jc6797WIA,1607360606.0,Forging a KATANA out of Rusted Iron CHAIN,"Well, This Katana took me too long to make and this was not easy to make it such perfect. Alot of People asked me to make Katana so i tried my best to make a perfect Katana Sword as i can. 

Overall Sword Length : 35 Inches
Handle Length : 8 Inches
Blade Length : 26 Inches

All the Processes are below of making this beautiful KATANA:
Forging:
          It took me almost three days to hand forge an Iron Chain piece into a long Metal Strip and this was one of my hardest forging ever. I don't have a power hammer so i did all the forging with hands and turned a chain piece into an almost 33 - 34 inches long steel strip.   
Grinding:
          I started some rough grindings of long strip on my Belt sander and turned the strip into a Katana shaped long steel piece. I also hand sanded the edges with the help of file to remove almost all the roughness of the sword.
          o. I made the Blood Groove with the help of rotary grinder.
          o. The blade bevel was made by my professional angle grinder.
          o. Hand Sanded the blade to remove roughness.
Hardness:
          There is a professional way to harden a Katana and that is
                   Covering the whole sword in a Fire Clay (Insulation) Except the blade bevel.After that we put the sword into the fire and heat it to critical temperature. We use oil to Quench the heated sword in it. Now the Bevel is hard and the remaining sword is annealed. Tempering the blade is the best way to increase the Strength, Hardness and Toughness of the sword.
Hibaki:
           This piece is traditionally made by forging some copper or brass but we can also make it by casting these metals. And the purpose of hibaki is to hold the Sheath with the handle.
Handle:
           The Handle contains three parts.
            o.    GUARD: I made the guard by using a thick brass sheet, which is roundly turned into a beautiful metal piece that can show a partition between the handle and the remaining sword.
            o.     Spacer: This is the little metal piece which fits on tang and controls the fittings of the whole handle so nothing should vibrate in handle.
            o.     Wood: A nice piece of wood uses as a handle of the sword and that could be Wrapped by some soft (leather) strips.

Reviewing movie deaths ranging from great to mediocre to downright terrible, he broke down what went right and wrong in the actors' performances.

Sometimes an over-the-top movie death works, and sometimes the dramatics are better kept to a minimum. According to Gilardi, an actor's approach to their character's death should always depend on the story they're telling. Using examples from classic movies like ""The Godfather Part III,"" ""Moulin Rouge!,"" and ""Scarface,"" Gilardi pointed out common pitfalls that make it easy for any actor to bungle a death scene — even for Oscar-winning film stars, like Natalie Portman and Marion Cotillard, and veteran actors who have racked up dozens of on-screen deaths, like Sean Bean and Samuel L. Jackson. He critiqued the best and worst villain deaths, from the defeat of Commodus in ""Gladiator"" to Talia al Ghul's final monologue in ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" and pinpointed why these deaths either resonated with audiences or fell short. And he compared the hits and misses of slow-motion deaths, from Willem Dafoe's famous arms-in-the-air scene in ""Platoon"" to Christopher George's slo-mo death by shuriken in ""Enter the Ninja.""

mVeQUbF9pqA,Insider,UCHJuQZuzapBh-CuhRYxIZrg,1596636571.0,Pro Acting Coach Breaks Down 13 Rage Scenes | Good & Bad Acting,"Acting coach Keira Duffy critiques 13 of Hollywood's most famous — and infamous — rage fits. She reviews anger scenes ranging from great to mediocre to downright terrible, breaking down what went right and wrong in the actors' performances.

Some of movies' most memorable scenes feature actors getting mad — whether it's an action star like Arnold Schwarzenegger delivering his notorious ""choir boy"" quote in ""End of Days,"" the legendary Samuel L. Jackson giving his Ezekiel 25:17 speech in ""Pulp Fiction,"" or master of anger Jack Nicholson shouting down Tom Cruise in ""A Few Good Men."" So, what separates the highs from the lows? With scenes featuring some of cinema's most famously angry characters, from Regina George's piercing scream in ""Mean Girls"" to Howard Beale's TV diatribe in ""Network,"" Duffy breaks down why certain performances of anger resonate with audiences while others fall flat.

Duffy deconstructs the greatness of Denzel Washington's ""King Kong"" speech from ""Training Day,"" traces the arc of emotion in Leonardo DiCaprio's rage fit from ""The Great Gatsby,"" and discusses went wrong in Sylvester Stallone's viral one-liner from the comic-book adaptation ""Judge Dredd."" She analyzes Angela Bassett's celebrated monologue from ""Waiting to Exhale,"" and examines the improvised acting choices that make the scene feel so cathartic. 

In addition to dramatic scenes, Duffy looks at comedic depictions of anger, from Kristen Wiig's bridal-shower rant in ""Bridesmaids"" to Nicolas Cage's airport tantrum in ""Honeymoon in Vegas,"" and talks about how comic actors use physicality to play anger for laughs. And in the courtroom scene from ""A Few Good Men,"" Duffy compares the righteous anger of Tom Cruise's young lawyer from the smug, defiant outrage of Jack Nicholson's colonel, and talks about how the actors escalate the scene right up to Nicholson's classic line, ""You can't handle the truth!"" Throughout the video, Duffy points out techniques that top-notch actors use to make their freakouts feel real and visceral on camera, as well as common mistakes that can make anger veer into ridiculousness — and in some cases, unintentional comedy.

Pro Acting Coach Breaks Down 13 Rage Scenes | Good & Bad Acting",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mVeQUbF9pqA/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-15 14:10:28.246731
m8LH8YXV0D4,Insider,UCHJuQZuzapBh-CuhRYxIZrg,1602879076.0,Pro Acting Coach Breaks Down 10 Crying Scenes | Good & Bad Acting,"Acting coach Jonna Johnson reacts to 10 iconic crying scenes from movies, reviewing the highs and lows of the actors' performances.
Every movie star has their own cry face, from Daniel Kaluuya's thick tears in the sunken-place scene from ""Get Out"" to Tobey Maguire's signature ""ugly cry"" from the ""Spider-Man"" movies. When it's time for the tears to roll on camera, some actors go for a single droplet strategically placed on the cheek, while others like to unleash the full waterworks. Some draw in the audience by emoting hard, like Julianne Moore does with her unbridled sobbing in ""Still Alice;"" others tell a story through subtle facial movements, as Jennifer Lopez does in a teary confrontation scene from ""Hustlers."" 

With such a wide variety of crying styles, what makes some sob scenes pack an emotional punch — while others strike audiences as goofy or overdone? In this episode of ""Good & Bad Acting,"" Johnson unpacks 10 of the best and worst cinematic tears, from Viola Davis' visceral monologue in ""Fences"" to Nicolas Cage's cartoonish breakdown in ""Vampire's Kiss."" 
Johnson evaluates how various shades of crying suit different genres and styles of film, ranging from Reese Witherspoon's over-the-top breakup cry in the classic 2001 rom-com ""Legally Blonde,"" to Heather Donahue's dread-filled apology in the 1999 found-footage horror flick ""The Blair Witch Project,"" to Leonardo DiCaprio's collapse into tears in the dark 1995 drama ""The Basketball Diaries."" She deconstructs the greatness of Marlon Brando's primal yelling in ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" pointing out the shades of anguish and vulnerability in the way Brando voices those cries of ""Stella!"" Johnson dissects the nuances of actors' approaches to weeping on camera, from the build-up of snot seen in ""Fences"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" to the tensed facial muscles seen in ""Hustlers"" and ""Get Out. 

Throughout the video, Johnson pins down the acting choices that make some cries come as forced or insincere, while others read as authentic emotional behavior on screen.

THIS CLIP
The best conducting lesson you will ever have.  Witty, charming and unmistakably British, Rainer Hersch (""Victor Borge for a new generation"" The London Times) explains with laugh-out-loud comedy what does a conductor do?  The myths about conductors and conducting are gently exploded.  Here are five reasons everyone can understand, whether you are seasoned orchestral musician or couldn't tell a baton from your bottom. Starting with setting the tempo and showing when the musicians should actually start playing, the conductor needs to be seen by everyone.   Then there is giving cues to the players and adjusting the balance.  This is funny and informative.  But don't let him fool you, a monkey could do it.

ABOUT RAINER HERSCH
A trained conductor and pianist, British stand-up comedian Rainer Hersch has performed on every comedy stage in the UK and in more than thirty countries across the world.  He has conducted orchestras from The St Petersburg Philharmonic to the Tasmanian Symphony.  Rainer and his own 'Orkestra' are on tour in Autumn 2020 https://www.rainerhersch.com/whatson/

Antonio Stradivari is generally considered the greatest violin maker of all time. His violins are played by some of the top musicians in the world and sell for as much as $16 million. For centuries people have puzzled over what makes his violins so great and they are the most scientifically studied instruments in history. I spoke to two world class violinists who play Stradivarius violins as well as a violin-maker about what makes Stradivari so great.

qJT2h5uGAC0,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,1565619792.0,We measured pop music’s falsetto obsession,"From Justin Timberlake to the Bee Gees, we charted the popularity of men singing high.
Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

It’s nearly impossible to turn on the radio and not hear a male artist singing really high. Likely he’s a tenor, and more often than not he’ll sing in falsetto. Think Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, Bruno Mars, Drake, Charlie Puth, Shawn Mendes, Adam Levine, Sam Smith ... the list goes on and on and on. 

This isn’t a trend — it has been the status quo for decades. 

Using the data diving know-how of The Pudding, and drawing on the expertise of Anthony Roth Costanzo, a professional opera singer, I dig into the world of the high male vocal range by tracking how pervasive it really is across the decades.

UIge2mYdTtM,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,1580318778.0,"That famous cello prelude, deconstructed","Bach's G major prelude has captivated cellists and music lovers for years. Cellist Alisa Weilerstein deconstructs it.

Bach's six cello suites are considered a rite of passage for cellists. They're masterpieces of classical music, and the prelude in G major — the first movement of the suites — is perhaps the best example of Bach's power as a composer. In it, he's able to achieve rich and complex harmonic movements with just a four-stringed instrument, while using the very basic tenets of music composition. Those basic tenets are what Alisa Weilerstein, a renowned cellist and McArthur fellow, helps us understand. 

A previous version of this video mislabeled a C sharp as a C natural. We also removed a simplified chord visual that mislabeled a C natural as a C sharp.

cdl8p9akJJw,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,1530650283.0,Why the US national anthem is terrible — and perfect,"Vox's Estelle Caswell and Joss Fong debate ""The Star Spangled Banner""

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

When Francis Scott Key attached his poem about the War of 1812 to a popular British song called ""To Anacreon in Heaven,"" he kicked off over 200 years of painfully bad singing by patriotic Americans. The Star Spangled Banner became the official national anthem of the United States in 1931, but it had been used by the Army and Navy for decades before that and was popular from the start. One big problem? The melody wasn't exactly written for the masses, but for trained soloists. 

Commentators pointed out early on that it was exceedingly difficult for most people to sing, suggesting that ""America the Beautiful"" might be a better alternative. Critics have noted that the music requires a uniquely wide vocal range, it's full of tricky intervals, and the lyrics are confusing and uninspiring. 

But if you look at the national anthem as a sport, where we get to watch performers at the top of their game tackle the gauntlet that is the Star Spangled Banner, you may come to appreciate it. In this video, we debate whether the difficulty of the Star Spangled Banner is a feature or a bug for a national anthem.

A personal thank you to Air Force MSgt Ryan Crane for nominating me for this flight.  Thank you sir.

The Thunderbirds have a YouTube Channel
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_edytVWM8iumngqzTVLVw

This flight took place on May 3, 2019 in Biloxi Mississippi.  The reason it took so long to release is the high amount of research I wanted to do before releasing the video.  I even visited the Air Force Research Lab at Wright Patterson AFB to discuss some aspects of this video with Aerodynamicists.  Synchronizing all this footage and coordinating additional B Roll with the Thunderbirds Public Affairs Officer also required a lot of effort.  

These are my own thoughts, not those of the U.S. Air Force or the Thunderbirds:
I've been around a lot of pilots and ground crew in my life and I must say that the professionalism displayed by the Thunderbirds was astounding.  Their goal is to inspire and demonstrate the capabilities of the US Air Force, so I'll take it a step further.  If you're a smart young person who is interesting in changing your life for the better, strongly consider the Air Force.  The job market isn't the best at the moment but the Air Force still has opportunities available for you to learn incredible skills even if you're not interested in flying.  They manage everything from logistics, electronics, aerospace, cyber and even space systems.  The threats to freedom are becoming more complex, and in my experience working for the Department of Defense over a 15 year span (even longer if you count my work as a contractor) The US Air Force consists of some of the most intelligent service members our country has.  These people are book-smart, but also have the confidence to solve real world problems with their own hands.  If I have a complex aerodynamic question, my first call is usually to someone in the Air Force, because they understand these complex phenomena intuitively.  For example, in this video you would hear Flack and I talking about pitot tubes in flight.  We also had other discussions about fuel burn rates, Prandtl Glauert, weather.... all kinds of things.  Simply put, if you're looking for direction in your life, and you're good with science and math... consider the Air Force.  That being said, they also need other types of skills as well.  Logisticians, writers, creative people who know how to solve complex problems in unique ways.

SUBSCRIBE NOW to CBR! Click here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-CBR

The Jurassic Park franchise has definitely come a long way since the first Stephen Spielberg film way back in 1993. There’s been a lot of dinosaurs, a lot of destruction, and a lot of expenses not being spared! If you have trouble keeping up with the franchise based on the Michael Crichton novels, you’ve come to the right place because we’re going to break down the timeline and give you a complete history of the movies. We’ll talk about the first film, venture into the Lost World, and talk about the future of Jurassic World: Dominion. Of course, we couldn’t be more excited about seeing Dr. Alan Grant, Dr. Ellie Sattler, and Dr. Ian Malcolm back on the big screen together. There are also some non feature length pieces of media worth mentioning including the Battle at Big Rock and Camp Cretaceous. John Hammond definitely believed in sparing no expense when it came to starting his own dinosaur infested park, and we promise to spare as few details as possible as we take a look back at this series.

What do you think about the fact that the franchise is still going strong after all of these years? Do you yearn for the simpler days of animatronic dinos or are you looking forward to seeing where the series goes next?

So we asked John Collins, who set the Guinness World Record for farthest flight by a paper aircraft in 2012, to teach us a thing or two about the squash fold and perfect winglets. In this tutorial, he shows us how to fold three planes:

The Suzanne—the plane he set the world distance record with, named after his wife.

The Tube—a tube-shaped plane you throw like a football.

And, finally, the Boomerang—a stunt plane capable of circling left and right and performing loops.

Ready to fly? Grab a stack of paper, press play (pause as often as you need to) and fold away.

John Collins, also known as 'The Paper Airplane Guy,' teaches us how to fold and fly our very own ""Tube"" paper airplane. The Tube doesn't look like much, but it can certainly fly! You throw the Tube very much like you throw a football, letting the ring spin off of your fingertips. That rotation helps create lift, and lets the airplane do its thing.

Hn_iozUo9m4,The Efficient Engineer,UCXAS_Ekkq0iFJ9dSUIkcAkw,1588540186.0,Understanding and Analysing Trusses,"In this video we'll take a detailed look at trusses. Trusses are structures made of up slender members, connected at joints which can be approximated to pinned connections.

It is typically assumed that loads are applied to the joints of the truss, not directly to the members. Because of this, the members only carry axial forces - they do not carry bending moments. The internal force in each member is constant, and a member can be either in tension or in compression.

It is important for engineers to be able to determine the axial force in the members of a truss, so that they can be designed appropriately. In this video I cover the two main methods for doing this, which are the Method of Joints and the Method of Sections.

The Method of Joints involves applying the equilibrium equations to solve the internal forces acting on every joint within the truss.

The Method of Sections involves creating an imaginary cut through the members of interest, and applying the equilibrium equations to the external and internal forces.

He is also a Christian.  In this talk he describes what nanotechnology is, how it might be used to help solve global problems such as climate change and how we might begin to answer questions such as ‘what does God think about nanotechnology?

A new industrial revolution is underway in which nanotechnology is being deployed in real products and offering possible solutions to climate change, water scarcity and growing healthcare needs as well as providing further answers to questions of origins of life. Is nanotechnology therefore a force for good, bringing relief to people in need and shedding further light on what it means to be human? Should faith communities embrace it positively? Or is it a threat, offering rival explanations for the origins of life and risking enormous environmental damage should it ever escape from our control? Professor Cowburn, who is both a nanotechnologist and a Christian, will give an overview of nanotechnology and discuss the ethics and theology of this new technology

GNZBSZD16cY,TEDx Talks,UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q,1373331368.0,Beatbox brilliance | Tom Thum | TEDxSydney,"Never miss a talk! SUBSCRIBE to the TEDx channel: http://bit.ly/1FAg8hB

Tom Thum: Armed with just a microphone, Thum pushes the limits of the human voice to create incredible soundtracks of impossible beats and phenomenal sounds, with scratched vinyl, the Michael Jackson back-catalogue, the didgeridoo and an entire fifties jazz band amongst his vocal repertoire. 

You can follow Tom on FaceBook (TomThummer) and Twitter (@tomthummer)

Quoting from ABC's Triple J Unearthed website:

""TOM THUM, THE VERSATILE VOICEBOX 'Tom Thum appears to have swallowed an entire orchestra and several backing singers' The Guardian (UK)

'There are not enough superlatives to describe the wonder of this beatboxing virtuoso - I am still trying to figure out how he got those sounds out of his mouth' The Daily Telegraph (UK)
'The mic master seems to have an orchestra living in his throat: trumpet blasts, guitar strums and samples from classic songs including Michael Jackson's ""Billie Jean"" effortlessly spout from his mouth' Time Out, NY

These are apt quotes to describe the performance of one of Australia's most prominent and respected beatboxers and serial pests. Only in his mid-twenties Tom Thum has achieved and experienced more than most artists could hope to achieve in a lifetime. From winning the team battles (alongside Joel Turner) in the World Beatbox Championships in 2005, to fulfilling every artists dream and performing on Broadway in New York with the Tom Tom Crew, Tom has seen his fair share of accolades and well and truly paid his dues. Raised by the small but accommodating Brisbane hip hop scene, Tom started out as a graffiti writer and a Bboy but slowly rose to recognition through his ability to produce unhuman sounds and his natural knack for performing and weaselling his way on stage...

Although the stage seems the ideal habitat for Tom he is also no stranger to community and has been helping the scene improve through conducting a plethora of workshops in many places that usually wouldn't have access to such knowledge and skill. Tom has travelled from the very top of Australia teaching in the Indigenous communities of Mornington and Thursday Islands all the way to the very bottom with a series of workshops in Tasmania and Adelaide. 

He has also spent considerable time teaching on Palm Island and in Charleville and many other places that would otherwise be Starved for education about proper hip hop and the positive message that music preaches.

As Tom's experience within the music industry expands, he plans to push the limits of the human voice as far as inhumanly possible. Enrolling the help of numerous loop stations, Tom has been conducting DJ sets using only his voice and nothing else, propelling crowds across the country into a frenzy of jaw-dropping disbelief, as he re-creates and remixes classic joints and jams from all eras and genres. At present Tom is working on an album ranging across many different generes and features and hopes to have it finished by early 2012. You might see him on a stage at a festival looping up a storm or supporting anyone from the Hilltop Hoods to Blue King Brown, or you might catch him annoying the hell out of commuters on public transport. Either way, you will notice him soon enough. Keep an ear out for Tom Thum.""

Check out Mars on National Geographic, Monday Nov 12 at 9/8c
#sponsored

When I got offered the chance to fly in another #zeroG plane, I jumped at the chance. Do you know how hard it is when you are thrust into low-gravity, like the 37% of Earth's gravity of Mars, and you have to remember what you were going to say in a 30 second window as blood floods your head? It's pretty hard. It would be even harder to actually travel to Mars. It would take about 8 months in microgravity during which time your muscles and bones would weaken substantially, even if you exercise for hours a day like the astronauts on the space station. And your heart is a muscle too so it weakens as well. Before I contemplated these rates of muscle and bone loss, I thought the major challenge with a round trip journey to Mars would be the logistics of spacecraft and having enough fuel to get back. But with the weakening of the human body, it's an open question whether anyone would really want to come back.

T-cells form an integral part of the human immune system by fighting off infection and eliminating transformed cells. Over the last decades numerous T-cells subsets with different functions and abilities have been identified (Farber et al. Nat Rev Immunol 2014). The wide spread use of monoclonal antibodies and multi-color flow cytometry allows for the routine identification of these subsets based on their immune-phenotype (Chattopadhyay et al. Cytometry 2012). However, the increasingly detailed understanding and the dynamic nature of different T-cell subsets also results in a dramatic increase in the complexity of the antibody panels used.

Here, we will demonstrate the identification of naïve, memory and effector T cells at various stages of differentiation, but also the detection of rare populations such as stem cell like memory T cells and different Treg subpopulations using a 13-color marker combination that allows for the identification of T cell subtypes according to classical and more recent characterization criteria. We will outline the panel design rational taking into account expression patterns as well as fluorochrome characteristics. The applied gating strategies will be discussed.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wz8zHZOc2Q4/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-16 17:03:01.598879

What do I need to know about fixation and permeabilization and the protocol for flow cytometry? Hi, I'm Rob, Senior Research Associate in the Flow Cytometry Group at Cell Signaling Technology, and this is CST tech tips.

Flow Cytometry can be performed with live cells if all of your targets are expressed on the extracellular surface. But when you're targeting intracellular proteins, the cells will need to be fixed, permeabilized and immunostained with antibodies and/or conjugated antibodies in that order. 

Fixation cross-links macro-molecules in the cells and locks the target proteins in place, and permeabilization allows antibodies to access the intracellular space. Here are some considerations to keep in mind when performing a fix-perm protocol. First, you can find the recommended fixation and permeabilization protocol for each flow validated antibody on https://cellsignal.com. Just type the product number in on the search bar to bring up the product page. 

Prior to fixation, your cells need to be in a single-cell suspension to ensure accurate readout and analysis. If you're starting material is adherent cells or tissues, you'll need to thoroughly dissociate the cells with trypsin or other proteases. Once you have your single cell suspension, you can proceed with fix, perm, and staining steps in individual flow tubes, or you can fix and perm large batches of cells and aliquot them for subsequent analysis. 

For many antibodies, the recommended fixative is formaldehyde, the aqueous monomeric form of formaldehyde. Fixing the cells prior to permeabilization helps to minimize loss of target proteins and preserve signaling states. This is particularly important when characterizing signaling activities, for example, with phospho-specific antibodies. 

After fixation, ensure the fixative is thoroughly washed out. This avoids excessive crosslinking of proteins within the cell and eliminates the risk of antibodies being crosslinked to non-specific targets by leftover fixative. Once the cells are fixed and washed, they're ready to be permeabilized. 

Some antibodies require use of a specific permeabilization reagent, while others work equally well with multiple reagents. Again, you can find the recommended permeabilization reagent in the antibody product page on https://cellsignal.com. 

The majority of our flow validated antibodies against intracellular targets can be used with methanol permeabilization. Solvents like methanol can provide more access to the interior of organelles such as nuclei, mitochondria and lysosomes. In certain cases, methanol affects the structure of the epitope. This could positively or negatively affect detection depending on the antibody and epitope. Detergents likes saponin can better preserve the native structure of epitopes but may not provide as much access. 

After your cells are fixed and permeabilized, you're ready to proceed with antibody staining steps. 

Thanks for watching. If your flow experiment will incorporate both surface markers and intracellular targets, check back for upcoming video on multiplexing. If you found this video helpful, please hit the like and subscribe buttons for more Tech Tips. Anytime you have a question about an antibody or protocol, get in touch with the scientist at https://cellsignal.com/support. Good luck with your experiments, and we'll see you next time.

Results can easily be affected by poor cellular viabilities, the presence of non-target cells or debris, as well as by a high contaminating background of free DNA or RNA. In addition, harsh conditions during sample preparation workflows can easily cause alterations to transcriptome, and thereby generate unwanted artifacts. This is especially troublesome if you are interested in genes related to cellular stress, activation, or metabolism. A solution to this is to make use of only non-stressed, viable target cells of high purity in your genomics experiments. The trick is getting them. 
In this webinar you will learn:
1. Which sample preparation steps can introduce artifacts in your NGS data and how to best avoid common pitfalls, in particular when cell sorting is required prior to analysis
2. How this critical cell sorting step can be designed to be more gentle and have less of an impact on cells by
3. How other scientists have mastered cell sorting and gained high quality data

Fluorophores accept light at a specific wavelength and re-emit it at a higher wavelength, giving each fluorophore an excitation and emission wavelength. Although there is a peak or maximal emission, the range is often several hundred nanometers. This can cause problems where unwanted light enters several detectors giving false positives. Compensation is required to remove this unwanted fluorescence. Careful choice of fluorophores can reduce the amount of compensation needed.

This webinar will cover:

- Basic fluorescence principles
- What is compensation and why you need to apply it
- Compensation controls
- How to avoid compensation in small panels
- Common rules to help build more complex panels

--

What shape are your cells? Squishy cylinders? Jagged zig-zags? You might not spend a lot of time thinking about the bodies of these building blocks, but microscopically, small variations can have huge consequences. And while some adaptations change these shapes for the better, others can spark debilitating complications. Amber Yates dives into the science of the malignant sickle-cell mutation.

Every day in an adult human roughly 50-70 billion of your cells die. They may be damaged, stressed, or just plain old - this is normal, in fact it’s called programmed cell death.

To make up for that loss, right now, inside your body, billions of cells are dividing, creating new cells.

And cell division, also called mitosis, requires an army of tiny molecular machines.DNA is a good place to start - the double helix molecule that we always talk about.

This is a scientifically accurate depiction of DNA. If you unwind the two strands you can see that each has a sugar phosphate backbone connected to the sequence of nucleic acid base pairs, known by the letters A,T,G, and C.

Now the strands run in opposite directions, which is important when you go to copy DNA. Copying DNA is one of the first steps in cell division. Here the two strands of DNA are being unwound and separated by the tiny blue molecular machine called helicase.
It literally spins as fast as a jet engine! The strand of DNA on the right has its complimentary strand assembled continuously but the other strand is more complicated because it runs in the opposite direction.
So it must be looped out with its compliment strand assembled in reverse, section by section. At the end of this process you have two identical DNA molecules, each one a few centimeters long but just a couple nanometers wide.

To prevent the DNA from becoming a tangled mess, it is wrapped around proteins called a histones, forming a nucleosome.
These nucleosomes are bundled together into a fiber known as chromatin, which is further looped and coiled to form a chromosome, one of the largest molecular structures in your body.
You can actually see chromosomes under a microscope in dividing cells - only then do they take on their characteristic shape.

The process of dividing the cell takes around an hour in mammals. This footage is from a time lapse. You can see how the chromosomes line up on the equator of the cell. When everything is right they are pulled apart into the two new daughter cells, each one containing an identical copy of DNA.
As simple as it looks, this process is incredibly complicated and requires even more fascinating molecular machines to accomplish it. Let’s look at a single chromosome. One chromosome consists of two sausage-shaped chromatids - containing the identical copies of DNA made earlier. Each chromatid is attached to microtubule fibers, which guide and help align them in the correct position. The microtubules are connected to the chromatid at the kinetochore, here colored red.
The kinetochore consists of hundreds of proteins working together to achieve multiple objectives - it’s one of the most sophisticated molecular mechanisms inside your body. The kinetochore is central to the successful separation of the chromatids. It creates a dynamic connection between the chromosome and the microtubules. For a reason no one’s yet been able to figure out, the microtubules are constantly being built at one end and deconstructed at the other.
While the chromosome is still getting ready, the kinetochore sends out a chemical stop signal to the rest of the cell, shown here by the red molecules, basically saying this chromosome is not yet ready to divide
The kinetochore also mechanically senses tension. When the tension is just right and the position and attachment are correct all the proteins get ready, shown here by turning green.
At this point the stop signal broadcasting system is not switched off. Instead it is literally carried away from the kinetochore down the microtubules by a dynein motor. This is really what it looks like. It has long ‘legs’ so it can avoid obstacles and step over the kinesins, molecular motors walking the other direction.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.

Op3r_dB3ISk,The Thought Emporium,UCV5vCi3jPJdURZwAOO_FNfQ,1524576359.0,Extracting LIVE T Cells From Blood,"You were probably taught that there are 3 things in your blood: Red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells. The reality, as is often the case, is more complicated than that. White blood cells actually refer to a whole family of cells that all make up the different parts of your immune system. One of the main soldiers in your immune systems army are T cells which recognize foreign bodies and destroy them.

In some of the newest cancer therapies scientists are using genetic engineering to teach a patients own T cells how to find cancer cells so that they can be destroyed. This way only cancer cells are damaged and the rest of the body remains healthy, unlike in traditional chemotherapy and radiation.

Over the past several months I've been in Florida visiting my friend Gabriel Licina and his mammalian cell culture lab. While there I got to film the process of extracting T cells from whole blood which uses some incredible biochemistry to make possible.

Prisca Liberali shows why this view of disease is shortsighted and can be improved with organoids.

The intro animation was produced as a collaboration between TEDxBasel and the Hochschule Luzern. This animation was created by Benjamin Lüthold, Rhoda Berger and Ramona Graf.  Find out more about this event and the other ideas that were shared at www.tedxbasel.com  Prisca is a scientist and group leader at the FMI in Basel. She is Italian, but born in Brussels where she spent most of her childhood. Prisca got her Masters degree in chemistry in Rome and then moved to biological studies during her PhD in Italy and postdoc at the UZH and ETH in Zurich. Currently, she is an assistant professor at the University of Basel. Her laboratory at the FMI studies the self-organisation properties of cellular systems using in-vitro stem cell models named organoids.

Organoids made of human tissue can predict patient response to drugs. For more see: http://www.sanger.ac.uk/news/view/2015-05-07-patient-cancer-cells-help-to-test-treatments 
Organoids, small clusters of cells that accurately mimic the behaviour of human tissue, can be used to test cancer drugs and, eventually, to identify effective personalised treatments for patients.
Until now, cancer drug screening has primarily been carried out using two-dimensional cell lines grown in dishes, or in mouse models. Organoids, which more closely resemble human tumours than cell lines, and are less time and resource intensive than mouse models, offer researchers a middle ground between existing approaches.

Next generation sequencing allows DNA samples to be sequenced quickly and affordably. Learn how next gen sequencing works and get tips on preparing and running your samples. 

In the past decade there has been an amazing change in the efficiency of DNA sequencing. Using traditional Sanger sequencing, the human genome project took 20 years and cost $3 billion. Current next generation sequencing methods allow a human genome to be sequenced for $1000, in 48 hours!  In this talk, Eric Chow explains the chemistry behind next generation sequencing, and describes how the next gen sequencers detect and display results. The most commonly used Illumina sequencers are image based and detect the addition of fluorescently labelled nucleotides. Chow also describes two different next generation sequencing technologies which provide benefits such as much longer reads but with downsides such as higher error rates. Chow finishes the talk with some insights into medical applications of next gen sequencing such as much less invasive prenatal testing or cancer detection.  

In two short how-to videos, Chow gives advice on purifying DNA samples using magnetic beads and on determining the quality of your nucleic acid sample using an Agilent Bioanalyzer.

Watch this video to  learn some tips & tricks to improve your cell separation, The DynaMag™-5 magnet is optimized for gentle and tube-based magnetic cell separation using flow cytometry tubes. 

 

[Transcript]
Dynabeads magnetic cell separation is a gentle, tube-based technology, so there's no need for any columns. All you need is a magnet!
We released a series of DynaMag cell separation magnets a few years ago, which come in different formats for different needs. They can all be used to isolate pure, viable, and functional cells. Our latest magnetic technology for cell separation is designed specifically for working with FACS or flow cytometry tubes...
This new magnet uses all the great features of our existing magnets plus unique, additional features that make working with FACS or flow cytometry tubes even easier, faster, and more reliable.
The DynaMag-5 will hold any tube between 0.5 and 5 ml. The magnet is strong, and the separation is extremely quick. To make sure you capture all of the beads and cells, we recommend waiting 2 minutes.
Here are a couple additional tips on how to use this magnet.
You should always tilt the whole magnet a few times to make sure you don't lose any beads and cells that might be in the cap or cork. If there's any foam at the top of your sample, it might trap some cells, so shake gently to remove them. If you twist the tubes a little on the magnet, the beads at the tube-wall will form a tighter pellet, and you can lift the pellet a bit from the bottom of the tube. This is helpful for resuspension in smaller volumes.
Use your thumb to hold the tube in place while you open the cap or cork. This way you won't disturb the pellet.
Pull the cap towards you, and make sure you don't miss the few drops that might be caught in the cap.
Now you can pipet off or even decant the liquid, whichever you prefer. It's that easy! Just make sure you get rid of all the liquid. If you decant and there are some droplets left, you can use a small piece of paper. So now you can add your buffer, and lift the tube out of the magnet to resuspend the beadpellet. If you prefer, you can leave the tubes in the rack and resuspend up to 8 samples together. It's really easy to lift the rack off and put it back on the magnet. You can do it with one hand, or you can use both hands. Notice how the rack clicks into place. You can buy extra racks as a separate item.
Efficient washing is important, and here's a useful tip: you can get even better purity if you turn the tube 180º a couple of times. This way the beads and the bound cells will move through the buffer, and that's a great way to wash them.
Keep these tips & tricks in mind. And follow the protocol supplied with your specific product. You'll find that isolating pure, viable, and functional cells is both fast and easy when you use Dynabeads and a DynaMag Magnet!",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AG_zIvf9Dic/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-16 17:03:19.478277

Visit 👉https://www.cellsignal.com/flowcytometry for more information on validated products and optimized protocols for flow cytometry.

Transcript:

Cell processes are controlled by complex and dynamic intracellular signaling networks. Surface receptors pass information into the cell by modifying cytoplasmic proteins. These modifications include phosphorylation,. methylation, acetylation, which control a broad range of cellular functions, including growth, development, and apoptosis. Disruption of signaling networks often leads to disease. To understand signaling processes and normal and pathological conditions, identification and quantification of signaling proteins is necessary. Flow cytometry is ideal for such a task. 

Flow cytometry is a laser based technology widely used to phenotype cells using antibodies directed against surface markers. It can also allow simultaneous analysis of multiple intracellular targets using antibodies that detects and signaling proteins, their post-translational modifications, epigenetic modifications, and downstream transcription factors. 

The first step of intracellular flow cytometry is fixation of the cells using formaldehyde, which immobilizes proteins and preserves transient signaling events. Cells are then permeabilized with methanol or detergent, allowing antibodies to access to the intracellular space.

Optimal fixation and permeabilization conditions depend on the location and biochemistry of the target epitopes. It should be carefully considered to ensure successful antigen detection, especially when staining surface- and intracellular proteins simultaneously. 

Since multiple signaling proteins and surface antigens can be identified using fluorescently distinct antibodies, flow cytometry can readily characterize signaling profiles at the single-cell level within phenotypically distinct populations. This allows the characterization of the relationship between intracellular targets and enables detection of signaling events from rare-cell populations within a heterogeneous sample. 

Multiplex analysis of these protein targets saves time and resources while producing data-rich results, making flow cytometry an invaluable tool to unravel the complexities of cell signaling.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B2zreF2dnWk/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-16 17:03:19.478277

Transcript:
In this video, you will see how Dynabeads coupled w/ Protein A or Protein G allow for immunoprecipitation in just 3 simple steps. By using the beads & a magnet, you can pull the proteins or protein complexes gently out of your sample, and this simplifies the separation, washing, and elution steps. Bind the antibody to the magnetic beads, incubate w/ your sample, and after a couple of washes, elute your target protein.  The manual that comes with the product describes the protocol in detail.  This video offers a couple of additional tips & tricks.

You need to decide if Protein A or Protein G are best suited for your assay. This will depend on the type of antibody. You’ll find an overview of binding strengths in the product manual, and on our web pages. No columns or centrifuge is required.  The transparent top rack of the DynaMag-2 can be used as a sample rack.  

Make sure the Dynabeads are fully resuspended. For a standard isolation you’ll need 50 microliters, but you can easily scale the protocol to match your experimental set-up. You can work w/ concentrated samples throughout the procedure, and you won’t need to pre-treat or dilute the sample. 

You only need 1-10 micrograms of antibody. The exact amount will depend on your specific antibody, and you might want to titrate for minimal cost & maximum performance. During a short incubation, the antibody binds to the bead-surface via their Fc-region. To avoid co-elution along w/ your target protein later on, you can crosslink the antibody to the beads before you add the sample. You’ll find a detailed protocol on the web.

The beads are pulled to the side of the tube. Make sure you don’t lose any liquid hiding in the cap. Add sample, and pipette gently to resuspend. The rapid kinetics allow for a short incubation. This is especially important when you’re working w/ protein complexes that might otherwise dissociate or be damaged by proteases during a longer incubation.

All binding takes place on the outer surface of the beads. And - in contrast to sepharose – these polystyrene beads have no pores or inner surface of to trap contaminants, and hence background binding is very low. In most cases you won’t even need to pre-clear your sample.

The functionality of your antibody is critical for a successful result. If you know that your antibody has a low affinity, you might want to incubate for 20 minutes, or even up to two hours, as this can help increase the yield. This might also lead to higher background binding. Good mixing is important, and we recommend using a sample mixer that allows for tilting and rotation, such as the HulaMixer.

An alternative approach for low affinity antibodies or difficult targets is to incubate antibody & sample before you add the beads. This could improve the binding kinetics and keep nonspecific binding at a minimum.  This indirect approach is also a good alternative when you’re working w/ low abundance proteins, as well as for protein and nucleic acid complexes, e.g in a ChIP assay. Do not exceed the antibody binding capacity of the beads, as any excess free antibody will bind to the beads much faster than your protein complex will.

Remove all buffer without the risk of losing any of your sample. Magnetic separation allows for very easy washing. When you resuspend the beads, you should not introduce air. You don’t want to risk losing any protein bound to the few beads trapped in that foam. Transfer the beads to a clean tube for the final washing step, to avoid any carryover of contaminants bound to the tube wall or the cap.

You can either resuspend your target protein while still attached to the solid-phase and use this in your downstream experiments.  You can elute the protein directly in your buffer for gel analysis or western blotting. When you elute in a small volume, you can keep your protein concentrated. If you want to keep full protein integrity, you can elute under milder non-denaturing conditions. This is typically done by a 2-minute incubation at room temp using low pH or high salt. Bring your eluate back to physiological pH after elution. 

The Dynabeads Protein A or Protein G are available both as a stand-alone reagent, or as a part of ready-to-use kits w/ buffers included.  The beads are used for standard immunoprecipitation, and to pull down larger complexes in co-immunoprecipitation. They're also well suited for ChIP and more recently for RNA-immunoprecipitation.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FMMlDMzJnwE/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-16 17:03:19.478277

K2oN67JcSUI,Miltenyi Biotec,UCxZtDfOIok2BzYOzWvxiaHQ,1558523884.0,GMP-compliant cell sorting [WEBINAR],"In this webinar, you will learn about the unique microchip-based cell sorting technology of the MACSQuant® Tyto® Cell Sorter. Find out how this GMP-compliant system can enable an easy transfer of sorting protocols from research into clinical settings. For more information, visit www.miltenyibiotec.com/products/cell-manufacturing-platform/gmp-compliant-cell-sorting.html.

Recent advances in the field of immune-oncology have brought a number of new cell-based therapies, such as CAR-T cells, into the clinic and more cell therapy approaches with different types of cells are yet to come. 

One of the key hurdles in translating new cell-based therapies into the clinic, however, is the availability of GMP-compliant tools for the isolation and enrichment of specific cell types.
Fluorescence-based cell sorting (FACS) is the method-of-choice for identification and isolation of these specific cell types using multiple parameters. But, despite its wide-spread use in research, applications in clinical settings have proven difficult and expensive. Mainly, due to the lack of a fully closed sorting system that prevents samples from contamination. 

Miltenyi Biotec is the first company worldwide to offer GMP-compliant, fluorescence-based cell sorting in a fully closed and sterile system. 

Cell sorting on the MACSQuant Tyto happens exclusively within the MACSQuant Tyto Cartridge. Inside this closed system, cells are fully protected from environmental contamination and remain sterile at all times. The MACS GMP Tyto Cartridge, Running Buffer, and MACS GMP Fluorescent Antibodies were specifically developed for GMP-compliant cell sorting on the MACSQuant Tyto Cell Sorter and enable a smooth transition from research into clinical settings.

At this very second, you are on a narrow ledge between life and death. You probably don’t feel  it, but there is an incredible amount of activity going on inside you. And this activity can never stop.

Picture  yourself as a slinky falling down an escalator moving upwards – the falling part represents the self replicating processes of your cells, the escalator represents  the laws of physics, driving you forwards. To be alive is to be in motion but never arriving anywhere. If you reach the top of the escalator there is no more falling possible and you are dead forever. 

Somewhat unsettlingly, the universe wants you to reach the top. How do you avoid that and why are you alive?

In this episode, we discuss: Western Blot Optimization
- Get rid of your western blot ghosts by reducing background
- Keep your gel from saying ""cheese"" and smiling 
- Make that band shine as bright as a star by increasing your signal to noise 

We had so many great audience questions. Watch the whole video or quickly jump to a specific question:

00:10 Introduction
2:47 Is western blotting a quantitative technique? What is the general method to do quantitative western blotting?
6:17 Is film more sensitive and a better way to perform western blotting imaging?
10:50 How many times can a primary-antibody be used?
13:25 How crucial is it to do the Ponceau S Stain? And what is the best strategy for removing the stain prior to adding the blocking solution? And how many times can you strip the membrane to use for different protein detection?
18:23 When imaging different proteins one as experimental and one as a loading control (such as iNOS and beta-Actin), which have been separated from the same membrane by cutting, should they be imaged at the same time or separately? Or should they even be probed for on two separate blots?
22:40 Do you have tips for how to decrease the blots' background?
29:15 How do you prevent smiley faces on gels?
33:20 I am a new lab tech working with fluorescent western blots for the first time. The antibody we are using is clearly labeling a singular protein that is not our target protein. Could this be a problem with the secondary we are pairing with the primary? Could it be a problem with the buffer we are using with the primary? Any troubleshooting advice is appreciated!
39:09 Good morning, I've been struggling with WB of small molecular protein, like 16–22 ka for a while. I optimized it using shorter transfer time and smaller pores of filter and yet got a smeared band. Can you give me some advice?
41:23 If I am experiencing excessive protein left on my gels when transferring to a nitrocellulose membrane, how would I go about troubleshooting this issue to improve the transferring process?
44:04 How to avoid saturated/less exposure signals with different expression levels
48:34 Do you have advice on how to pick the right housekeeping protein for your experiment?
50:18 Why are western blots so challenging?
56:30 Closing

ibSbyFDxNyU,Bio-Rad Laboratories,UCuxoeifh8VFy-SxllarGZnQ,1598557387.0,WEBINAR — Expert Coffee Chats — Flow Cytometry Optimizations and Applications,"Join us for a chat with Bio-Rad application scientists about the current issues most relevant to your research. Jump to specific topics by following the links below.

In this episode, we discuss: Flow Cytometry Optimizations and Applications
 - Design and optimize a multicolor flow experiment
 - How to get your population of interest to pop out from your flow data
 - Increase lab efficiency and productivity with automated high throughput flow analysis
 - Flow cytometry applications

00:11 Introduction
3:25 I have never built my own panel before, where do I start? If I gave you my samples, could you help me build a panel?
8:15 How many cells would you recommend analyzing when you are looking for a rare (1%) population? What should my experimental set-up be in order to achieve statistical significance? How many cells are needed?
11:50 Can you advise how best to look at/evaluate spillover when you start running a new panel and how to proceed with making changes in fluorochrome combinations.
17:05 What is a good way to normalize data? For example: we represent a cell population as a percent of live or CD45. We can see a visible increase in the population of control vs treated, but it is not reflected in the numbers? How do we resolve this issue?
20:40 How is hydrodynamic focusing achieved? What is the physics involved behind it?
23:25 I have been told that single stained color controls for compensation should be as bright or brighter than in our samples. Is this true, and do you know why they need to be as bright or brighter?
28:25 Do you have any specific advice for flow cytometry/sorting of small extracellular vesicles (100nm – 700nm in diameter)?
31:50 We are performing longitudinal studies how can we correct for day to day variation and gradual laser deterioration?
35:52 Would you recommend using samples for your FMO controls or something like an UltraComp eBead? If using a sample and you have multiple conditions (e.g., pre/post exercise), does it matter which sample you use for your FMO?
39:19 How can Flow Cytometry be applied to detect Lymphomas?
44:12 What is a good resources for antigen density?
46:10 When you design an assay and plan to deploy it across different labs, are there decisions you would take early on to ensure the best homogeneity across instruments?
48:24 Are there any tools to help with the antibody titration?
49:35 What is the best control to set a size gate for microparticles, can beads be used for that?
51:30 I know it is always best to have as many controls as possible, but if you had to choose one, would you recommend doing isotypes or FMOs?
52:10 If you are using the same panel over and over do you have to use the FMO samples every time?
53:30 For staining of lymphocytes: Is it valid to prepare compensation controls from the blood and use them versus another tissue that does not have as many lymphocytes as the blood? If the answer is yes, then what is the best way to use those compensation controls to avoid any errors related to autofluorescence? 
55:00 When using different scales such as Bi-Ex or Logicle, does it matter what scales you used to set up your cytometer or acquire your data?
55:55 I am trying to do FACS on fibroblast, which are very difficult to count. I will compare sample one (a lot of cells) with sample 2 (a few cells). Will the staining be heavily affected by the number of cells, if I still will acquire the same number of cells? In the case the one with more cells will appear with a marker dimmer would that be due to the higher number of cells catching the antibody and giving a lower signal?
57:20 I am switching from single tubes to plate-based high throughput analysis, what precautions do I need to take? Any caveats? What are your software suggestions?

G34ov7J5PSE,LabRoots,UCP7xodi1WBjs2hNvEjow6ig,1418761408.0,Filippos Porichis - Detection of RNAs with flow cytometry,"Watch on LabRoots at http://labroots.com/user/webinars/details/id/437
     Single-cell analysis is one of the most rapidly growing fields in biomedical research that is significantly expanding our understanding on the biologic characteristics of various diseases. Flow cytometry has been the gold standard for immunologists due to its high throughput characterization of various cell types, however availability of antibodies can be restrictive. Recent advances in molecular biology enabled techniques to perform analysis of transcriptional expression at the single-cell level but these techniques follow laborious methods that involve cell sorting of individual cells and perplexing protocols for the isolation and amplification of RNA.

     This webinar will describe a novel flow-FISH (Fluorescent in situ hybridization) method for high-throughput detection of mRNA and miRNA at the single-cell level with flow cytometry.  It is based on a branched DNA technology that allows robust (up to 8,000 fold) signal amplification through a sequential hybridization of DNA branches followed by staining with labelled probes. By investigating human blood samples, we show that this novel technique enables simultaneous detection of several mRNA molecules in various leukocyte subsets identified by antibody staining for cell surface markers.  Similarly, we show how this technique can be readily used for detection of small miRNA molecules that play major regulatory roles in eukaryotic cells without being translated to proteins. Finally, we prove that this technique can be used in combination with the ImageStream technology, allowing for high-throughput visualization of mRNA in combination with protein expression at the single cell level. In conclusion, we describe a user friendly protocol that enables immunologists to perform in depth transcriptional analysis of single cells using flow cytometry.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G34ov7J5PSE/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-16 17:03:31.050557

5pprWg53BDk,Scientist Cindy,UCspCm8XWT98ooXXNOAVj5iw,1604344458.0,Flow Cytometry Virtual Laboratory,"welcome to the flow cytometry virtual
laboratory
flow cytometry is a tool that can be
used to get information about your blood
in this virtual lab you will use flow
cytometry to do a complete blood count
diagnose a type of leukemia a blood
cancer and look for any signs of cancer
that remain
after treatment blood is made up of
liquid called plasma
and multiple types of blood cells each
of which carries out a specific
job select a blood cell to learn more
red blood cells carry oxygen from our
lungs to all of the body's tissues
and they carry carbon dioxide away white
blood cells help us to fight infections
there are multiple types of white blood
cells each with a different specialty
when we have a cut platelets help stop
the bleeding by allowing blood to form a
clot
in a healthy person each type of blood
cell is present in predictable
proportions
if the proportions fall outside of what
is considered normal
it can be a sign that something is wrong
a complete
blood count or cbc is one of the most
commonly ordered lab tests the test
measures the proportions of different
types of cells
cbc tests used to be done manually by
looking at blood through a microscope
[Music]
in a few minutes a technician can count
about 100 to 200
cells let's see how many you can count
in a minute
an automated blood analyzer on the other
hand can count many thousands of cells
in just a few seconds its speed and
accuracy make it a much more popular
choice
[Music]
the machine draws in a small amount of
blood
red blood cells and platelets have
distinctive characteristics
so they can be counted with a method
based on electricity
the differences between white blood
cells are more subtle
to tell them apart the analyzer isolates
them
and then uses flow cytometry to count
them
[Music]
the cells pass through a narrow tube in
single file
one at a time they pass by a laser when
the light
hits the cell it scatters across from
the laser
a detector senses the amount of forward
light scatter
larger cells cause more forward scatter
and smaller cells cause less another
detector
senses the amount of side light scatter
cells with a lot of internal complexity
cause more
side scatter and simpler cells cause
less
computer software counts the cells and
plots their light scattering properties
on a graph
since each cell type has a different
scatter profile
we can use the graph to identify the
cell types present in the blood sample
and their proportions does this person's
blood count look normal
compare these results with those from a
healthy person
and note the differences
plot doesn't look quite right this
person has many more immature white
blood cells in their blood
than normal to get a better sense of
what's going on
take a look at the blood under the
microscope
the results suggest acute leukemia a
type of blood cancer
the patient's doctor will follow up to
see if these results
line up with any symptoms the patient
may be experiencing
leukemia happens when a stem cell in the
bone marrow
starts to divide out of control
bone marrow is where most of the cells
in our blood come from
in a healthy person stem cells there
divide to make new cells
which then mature and move into the
blood
in the acute type of leukemia immature
white blood cells grow too quickly and
fail to mature
they soon crowd out the other cell types
to stop the leukemia cells from growing
it is important to begin treatment right
away
but the right treatment depends on
identifying which type of cell is
growing out of control
the cbc results from our patient suggest
that they could have either b
cell or t cell leukemia but we don't
know which
these cell types look the same under a
microscope yet they respond very
differently to treatments
to find out which cell type is growing
abnormally in our patient
we will need to analyze a sample of
their bone marrow
add some lysis solution
this step breaks open certain types of
cells and leaves the ones that we're
interested in
intact next we'll add some tags
[Music]
the tags recognize specific molecules on
the surface of the cells
the molecules themselves are too tiny to
be seen but the tags will allow them to
be differentiated
the blue tag attaches to a molecule on
the surface of
b cells the orange tag attaches to a
molecule on the surface of
t cells to detect and measure the tags you'll
use a flow cytometer
as before the cells feed through in
single file
and a laser shines light on each cell as
it passes by
when the laser hits a tag it emits light
detectors
read forward and side scatter and the
color and the intensity of the light
that is emitted from the tags
the more tags and thus surface molecules
that are present on the cell
the more light it will emit computer
software
counts the cells and plots them on a
graph compare our patient's results
to those for b cell and t cell leukemia
which one looks more similar
after four weeks of treatment flow
cytometry is used once again to look for
cancer cells that remain in the bone
marrow

In this webinar, you will learn about an innovative approach to a traditional technology which encompasses several advanced features that are unusual for a flow cytometer.  For example, the CytoFLEX includes a communications technology called Wavelength Division Multiplier (WDM) that changes the paradigm of light collection techniques in flow cytometry.  This technology is also transformational in that it integrates APDs (Avalanche photo diode) instead of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) for fluorescence detection.  This is a revolutionary concept reduces the physical size and complexity of the instrument without compromising sensitivity and quality.  This webinar will include animated videos to help explain this new approach to cytometry.  At the end you will understand how new technology has been incorporated into the CytoFLEX flow cytometer to give you the edge in your research.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zIGD4ST8Fj0/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-16 17:03:36.464346

Around 15,000 people in the United States are diagnosed each year with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).  MDS occurs when the bone marrow does not properly produce one or more of the following: red blood cells, white blood cells and/or platelets. In the past it was thought MDS was only deadly when it developed into acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), but current research shows MDS can be fatal without reaching the stage of AML. Guillermo Garcia-Manero, M.D., professor in Leukemia, explains the basics, diagnosis, treatment and new therapies for myelodysplastic syndrome.

Will discuss Pathophysiology, Signs and Symptoms, Treatment and Prognosis 

Pathophysiology of Myelogenous Leukemia
The stem cells are found in the bone marrow which gives rise to myeloid stem cells which then give rise to myelobast and then the granulocytes (Eosinophils, Basophils, Neutrophils)

In Acute Myelogenous Luekemia there is an increase in Myeloblasts and may even involve myeloid stem cell which will affect red blood cells and platelets. In Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia there is an increase in Tyrosine Kinase which increases the number of the granulocytes that are found. 

ACUTE MYELOGENOUS LUEKEMIA 
Arrests at precursor stage with more than 20percent blasts in Bone Marrow. Blasts accumulate in bone marrow and goes to peripheral tissue. Common to have decreased Red Blood Cells and Platelets as Bone marrow gets crowded. Changes in Growth Factor causes arrest of development or decreased apoptosis. 

Myelodysplastic syndrome is a minor change in stem cells that is not cancerous yet, but it commonly develops into cancer. 

CLASSIFICATION – Currently classification is adopted by WHO which is based on therapeutic targets. 
1. AML wiith recurrent abnormalities 
           a. 8 21 translocation, 
           b. t(15 17) Promyelocytic Leukemia
                    i. Auer rods (M3). 
                    ii. PML RaR translocation (may be treated with retinoic acid)
2. AML with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (Poor Prognosis)
3. AML that is therapy related – due to cytotoxic agents
4. AML, not specified – classified from M0 to M7

CLINICAL - Sudden onset also may have thrombocytopenia, anemia, bone main and may affect liver, spleen, lymph node. After treatment patient may experience tumor lysis syndrome (high K, High Uric acid, High Phosphate, Low Calcium)

INVESTIGATIONS – Usually show normocytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Blood smear shows blasts which are myeloperoxidase positive. Bone marrow aspiration will show hypercellular with more than 20 percent blasts. Cytogenetic analysis help with prognosis. 

TREATMENT – Induction consists of 7 days of IV cytarabine with 3 days of short acting anthracycline to kills as much of blasts as possible. Consolidation to mop up left over with high dose cytarabine. If remission favorable and young age then continue more cycles of cytarabine. If no resmission or comorbidities than perform stem cell transplant and investigation therapies. 

PROGNOSIS – depends on age. As age increases the prognosis is worse

CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LUEKEMIA
PATHOGENESIS – Translocation between chromosome 9 (ABL1) and Chromosome 22 (BCL). ABL is responsible for production of tyrosine kinase which is tightly regulated. ABL transfers over to BCL on chromosome 22 known as ABL BCR fusion and the Philadelphia chromosome. This leads to constant production of tyrosine kinase. 

CLINICAL – has more insidious onset and found as incidental finding. Chronic phase is symptomatic but can be controlled with treatment. Accelerated phase there is an increase in the number of blasts and will be less responsive to treatment. Final stage is blast crisis is when it transforms to AML with extramedullary syndromes. 

INVESTIGATIONS – High level of leukocytosis that are LAP negative to rule out leukemoid reaction. Cytogenetic analysis is diagnostic. Flow cytometry identifies CD Markers present. 
TREATMENT – In chronic phase give imatinib meyslete which is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, but this is not a cure and the disease is always there. Accelerated blast crisis then look for hematopoietic stem cell transplant which is curative. Interferon alpha and Busulfan can be used while waiting for donor.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kdPNk7ZRHcY/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-16 17:03:37.703652
VLPpDoMBVK0,Subject Zero Science,UCRXRbi80k0_vcIfgpOSerTg,1567053900.0,Graphene Processors and Quantum Gates,"Graphene Processors and Quantum Gates

Since the 1960s, Moore’s law has accurately predicted the evolution trend of processors as to the amount of transistor doubling every 2 years. 
But lately we’ve seen something odd happening, processor clocks aren’t getting any faster. 
This has to do with another law called Dennard Scaling and it seems that the good old days with silicon chips are over.
Hello everyone, subject zero here!
Thankfully the solution might have been available for quite some time now and Graphene offers something quite unique to this problem, not only for your everyday processor types, but also Quantum computing.
In 2009 it was speculated that by now we would have the famous 400GHz processors, but this technology has proven itself to be a bit more complicated than previously thought however most scientists including me, believe that in the next 5 years we will see the first Graphene commercial hardware come to reality.

Transcript: It's Friday night, and you're staring into a microscope, hoping to see positive results from your immunohistochemistry experiment. Unfortunately, all you see is some indistinct fuzziness. 

So the data is inconclusive. It's a failure. 

We've all been there. Next week you'll come back and work on fixing the protocol. 

But where to start? 

You probably know that a highly specific, high affinity primary antibody is key to a successful IHC. But did you know that the companion reagents such as buffers, which establish the pH and ionic strength of the system, are just as important? These reagents can influence the binding of the primary antibody to its epitope and dramatically affect the outcome of the assay. 

To help you pick the best reagents for your assay and make sure those Friday nights in the lab are worth the effort, we will spend the next several videos reviewing how companion reagents affect IHC, and, as an example, we will describe our experience, optimizing the protocol for one of our antibodies. 

Let's get started. 

Step One. Antigen Retrieval. 

Several methods exist for revealing epitopes that have been massed by cross-linking fixatives like formalin. These include Proteolytic-Induced Antigen Retrieval, which relies on an enzyme like Proteinase K, or Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval, which uses heat to break apart cross-linked bonds and unwind proteins. 

Either method can unmask epitopes, rendering them accessible to the primary antibody and amenable to staining by IHC. At Cell Signaling Technology, we most often use Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval when testing our antibodies. So this is the method we will discuss in detail. 

Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval, also known as antigen unmasking, involves heating and cooling the tissue sections while they are immersed in a solution with a defined buffering capacity. The pH of the buffer helps keep the proteins unwound after the temperature is returned to normal. So the pH range of the system should be optimized to the antibody-epitope interaction of interest. The slightly acidic buffer citrate is effective at unmasking a wide range of epitopes, but some may require a more basic buffer, like EDTA. We use citrate buffer for Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval while optimizing the PLK Rabbit mAb protocol because it works for the widest range of epitopes. We kept this method constant as we did a stepwise change of the other companion reagents. 

Coming up next, Step Two.

How can I use flow cytometry to analyze activation of intracellular signaling pathways?  I’m Robert, senior research associate in the Flow Cytometry group. 

And I’m Sarah, development scientist at Cell Signaling Technology, and this is CST Tech Tips.

Flow cytometry is ideal for assessing signaling events in biological systems. It provides quantitative multiparametric readouts at the single cell level, with high sensitivity and speed. 

You can use flow cytometry to test hypotheses that certain stimuli, such as treatments with inhibitors, agonists, or antagonists, can modulate specific signaling activities.  Here are 5 tips to remember when you’re designing your experiments. 

#1 Phospho-Flow can be both practical and informative. Phosphorylation events are among the most commonly studied signaling mechanisms, and can be characterized with the use of phosphorylation specific antibodies. Using phospho specific antibodies in flow cytometry is not that different from using antibodies directed against other intracellular targets.  Protocols using formaldehyde to fix, and either a detergent or a solvent to permeabilize, are generally compatible with analyzing phosphorylation. Also, phosphatase inhibitors are usually not required, as protein crosslinking by the fixative also stops phosphatase activity. As with total protein  targets, the ideal protocol can vary by target and by antibody, so look for the recommended protocol for your CST antibody on https://www.cellsignal.com. 

#2 Timing is key. Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation can be transient, and the timing between your experimental stimulus and fixation can affect the magnitude of your readout. If the dynamics of your target of interest  are unknown, setting up a time course experiment can be informative. Some targets may be maximally phosphorylated after a matter of minutes, while others may take hours or even days to reach these peaks. 

#3 Sometimes, phosphorylation may not be the optimal readout for a signalling assay, as other modifications or even total protein expression levels may be a better indicator of signaling changes. Other post translational modifications including acetylation, methylation, and cleavage can also be analyzed by flow cytometry. For example, methylation specific antibodies are often employed in epigenetics studies, and cleavage specific antibodies can be used to assess apoptotic signaling. Once again, timing can be crucial. 

#4 If an antibody to your protein of interest isn’t available to provide a direct readout, you can consider choosing a downstream node in that signaling cascade to use as an indirect readout of that pathway. Remember to look for antibodies and antibody conjugates that have been validated specifically for flow cytometry. 

#5 Finally, including a known positive or negative control in your experiment can tell you if there is an issue with your experimental design, or if your antibody isn’t performing as expected. If a control treatment is known to modify the phosphorylation of your target, this can give you an idea of the magnitude of change to expect in the readout of your experimental samples.

ℹ️ CST Protocols: https://cellsignal.com/protocols

This webinar recording focuses on how to optimize two steps in the immunohistochemistry protocol. Antigen retrieval is required to reverse chemical crosslinks that can prevent antibodies from accessing their epitopes; the conditions of the primary antibody incubation step can affect strength staining obtained.

Transcript: - Hello, everyone. My name is Shidong. I'm the Account Manager at Cell Signaling Technology. Welcome to today's CST Learning Lab live session. Today, I'd like to introduce Chris Grange, who is one of our IHC scientists at Cell Signaling Technology. Chris has close to 10 years of experience working with varieties of immunohistochemistry techniques and different platform and technologies. His main focus right now and over his time with CST has been the development and validation of IHC-grade antibodies in a number of research areas. Today, we're going to discuss how antigen retrieval and your choice of antibody diluent can impact your IHC experiment. 

- [Chris] Today, I will briefly discuss two important considerations in the IHC assay; the antigen retrieval process, and the choice of a primary antibody diluent. After the presentation, I'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have. As everyone is likely aware, the IHC protocol involves a number of steps that can impact the results of your assay. Before you even begin your standing experiment, many of these pre-analytical steps have already occurred. These include tissue grossing and sizing, fixation, processing, embedding, and section. The analytical steps of the assay are listed here. And while all of them can have an impact on the quality of your staining, we will only be focused on antigen retrieval and the primary antibody diluent today.

But the data is not as conclusive as you might think - and my own study of 411 long haulers, along with fresh pre-print studies from teaching hospitals in the UK draw a very different picture. These antibody tests are not as effective as their manufacturers would have you believe. But why?

Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired hematologic (blood) condition involving irregular (paroxysmal) episodes of pink/red urine coloration that often occurs at night. The pathogenesis of this condition involves a mutation in a blood-making stem cell within the bone marrow. PNH is a very rare condition, often affecting individuals of certain age groups. In this lesson, we discuss the pathogenesis of PNH, along with the epidemiology, signs & symptoms, how PNH is diagnosed and how it is treated.

iEDZyOYTZnw,Apellis Pharmaceuticals,UC1VtZHFC9qOCaoZAasksAYQ,1543254760.0,"PNH, The Role of Complement in PNH, and The Potential of Inhibiting Complement C3","The complement system is an essential and powerful part of our immune defense system. Its main function is to coordinate the destruction and removal of infectious organisms, known and pathogens, or damaged cells in our body that need to be replaced.1 The complement system may be activated by three different pathways - the alternative, classical and lectin pathways that all run through Complement C3, the central protein in the cascade.1 C3 serves as the master switch controlling all downstream effectors that ultimately cause destruction of the cell. In situations where the complement system becomes over activated, it results in immune attack, the destruction of healthy cells, and ultimately causes illness and damage to the body.1

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, PNH, is a rare, acquired, potentially life-threatening blood disorder, characterized by chronic, complement-mediated destruction of red blood cells—hemolysis – and formation of life-threatening blood clots, also known as thrombosis.2,3

In PNH, the body’s stem cells acquire a gene mutation which results in the production of abnormal blood cells. These defective red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets, lack the connector, known as GPI, for two important surface proteins – CD55 and CD59 – that regulate complement activity.4 As a result, the complement protein C3 becomes unregulated, triggering all downstream effectors that ultimately cause destruction of blood cells.5,6 In intravascular hemolysis, the formation of the membrane attack complex, known as MAC, creates holes in red blood cells causing them to rupture inside blood vessels. At the same time, extravascular hemolysis is caused by C3b being deposited on the surface of defective red blood cells, tagging them for removal and resulting in their destruction in the liver and spleen. Inhibiting the C3 protein may prevent both intravascular and extravascular hemolysis.7  

APL-2 is an investigational therapy designed to help restore normal complement activity and reduce inflammation. By targeting C3, the central protein that serves as the master switch of the complement cascade, APL-2 has the potential to block activation from any complement pathway AND to prevent both intravascular and extravascular hemolysis, reducing the risk of thrombosis and anemia and transfusion dependency in patients with PNH.7 

Learn more about the role of the complement system in PNH and the benefits of C3 inhibition in the following video and at https://pnhstudy.com/

This video is all about a rare clonal hematopoetic disorder called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria abbreviated as PNH. PNH is because of the mutation in PIG A gene which codes for GPI (glycophosphotidylinositol). GPI is needed for anchoring DAF and CD59  on red cell membrane. In the absence of DAF and CD59 the red cells will be hemolysed by the compliment system. Complimented mediated hemolysis in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, PNH, leads to complement mediated intravascular hemolysis giving rise to hemoglobinuria, jaundice and anemia. PNH is diagnosed using sucrose hemolysis test or sugar water test, Hams test and flow cytometry.

odDsaIU7IBw,Apellis Pharmaceuticals,UC1VtZHFC9qOCaoZAasksAYQ,1541159598.0,About Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH),"Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, chronic, and potentially life-threating blood disorder that occurs when unregulated complement activity causes the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis) and the formation of life-threatening blood clots (thrombosis).1,2

PNH can affect people of any age, race, or gender.1,2 In PNH, the body’s stem cells acquire a gene mutation which results in the production of abnormal blood cells that lack two important surface proteins that act as a shield to protect the body from attack and destruction by complement, an important part of the body’s immune system.³ As a result, the complement protein C3 becomes overactivated in patients with PNH, which triggers two types of hemolysis at the same time:4,5

• Intravascular Hemolysis: occurs when the formation of membrane attack complexes (MACs) creates holes in red blood cells, causing them to rupture inside blood vessels
• Extravascular Hemolysis: occurs when C3b is deposited on the surface of defective red blood cells, tagging them for removal and destruction in the liver and spleen

This continued hemolysis can result in a chronic shortage of healthy red blood cells (severe anemia) and other symptoms such as kidney failure, high blood pressure in the lungs, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, blood in your urine, problems swallowing, erectile dysfunction, and fatigue.⁶ In addition to controlling anemia, re-establishing control of the complement system can help to reduce transfusion dependence and the risk of blood clot formation (or thrombosis) which is the leading cause of mortality in patients with PNH.⁶

Part 1: Introduction to T Cell Tolerance: When immunological tolerance fails, autoimmune diseases such as diabetes result. Mathis explains how T cell tolerance develops. 

Part 2: Transcription Factor Aire Orchestrates T Cell Tolerance: Mutation in the transcription factor Aire results in autoimmune attacks on numerous organs. Mathis tells us how Aire determines T cell tolerance. 

Talk Overview:
To successfully fight off microbial infections, our immune systems must recognize a broad and diverse array of peptides.  Occasionally, this results in the recognition of self-peptides and the development of autoimmune disease.  For example, if a T cell recognizes insulin, type-1 diabetes may result.  In her first talk, Dr. Mathis explains how the body has developed multiple mechanisms of immunological tolerance to prevent self-recognition.  She focuses in greater detail on two particular types of T cell tolerance: clonal deletion and suppression.

Patients with Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type-1, a disease that manifests as autoimmune attacks on many organs, are known to have a mutation in the transcription factor Aire.  Aire is expressed in a small subset of cells in the thymus, so how does it cause autoimmune disease in so many tissues? In Part 2, Dr. Mathis describes experiments from her lab showing that Aire regulates the transcription of many self-antigens in the thymus.  Expression of these self-antigens is required for the development of T cell tolerance; if Aire is mutated, autoimmunity results.

AKT can have a number of downstream results akin to activating CREB, inhibiting p27, localizing FOXO in the cytoplasm, activating PtdIns-3ps, and activating mTOR  which will influence transcription of p70 or 4EBP1. There are numerous identified causes that enhance the PI3K/AKT pathway together with EGF, shh, IGF-1, insulin, and CaM. The pathway is antagonized by way of various factors together with PTEN, GSK3B, and HB9. In lots of cancers, this pathway is overactive, for that reason lowering apoptosis and permitting proliferation. This pathway is critical, nonetheless, to advertise growth and proliferation over differentiation of adult stem cells, neural stem cells chiefly. It is the trouble in finding an proper quantity of proliferation versus differentiation that researchers are trying to verify in an effort to utilize this stability within the progress of quite a lot of therapies.

Mc61VOhhNkg,Hussain Biology,UCDCg5AAslixldHh5D7Nu6-g,1591702408.0,AKT/PKB Signaling Pathway | PI3k Signaling,"This video will be encompass the AKT/PKB Signaling Pathway .
The Akt Pathway, or PI3K-Akt Pathway is a signal transduction pathway that promotes survival and growth in response to extracellular signals. Key proteins involved are PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) and Akt (Protein Kinase B).
Initial stimulation by one of the growth factors causes activation of a cell surface receptor and phosphorylation of PI3K. Activated PI3K then phosphorylates lipids on the plasma membrane, forming second messenger phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). Akt, a serine/threonine kinase, is recruited to the membrane by interaction with these phosphoinositide docking sites, so that it can be fully activated.[1] Activated Akt mediates downstream responses, including cell survival, growth, proliferation, cell migration and angiogenesis, by phosphorylating a range of intracellular proteins. The pathway is present in all cells of higher eukaryotes and is highly conserved.
There are multiple types of phosphoinositide 3-kinase but only class I are responsible for lipid phosphorylation in response to growth stimuli. 
Akt resides in the cytosol in an inactive conformation, until the cell is stimulated and it translocates to the plasma membrane. The Akt PH domain has a high affinity for second messenger PI(3,4,5)P3, binding to it preferentially over other phosphoinositides.[11] Thus PI3K activity is essential for translocation of Akt to the membrane. Interaction with PI(3,4,5)P3 causes conformational changes and exposure of phosphorylation sites Thr308 in the kinase domain and Ser473 in the C-terminal domain. Akt is partially activated by phosphorylation of T308 by PDK1. Full activation requires phosphorylation of S473, which can be catalysed by multiple proteins, including phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 2 (PDK2), integrin-linked kinase (ILK)",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mc61VOhhNkg/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-16 17:03:51.570976

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/early-covid-signs

Headache and Fatigue 

Dark Horses of COVID Symptoms

Most commonly experienced early symptoms are:

Headache, 82%

Fatigue 72%

This is the case for all age groups

9% of COVID-positive adults aged 18 - 65 didn’t experience headache or fatigue

1% of people who reported fatigue and/or headache tested positive for COVID

3% of people who tested positive had headache and fatigue alone

Therefore

Having either or both of those symptoms alone is unlikely to be indicative of COVID.

The Classic Three are Still Key

Cough, fever, loss of smell

40% of all age groups, fever in the first seven days

https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drug/remdesivir.html

Conditional recommendation against the use of remdesivir in hospitalized patients

Regardless of disease severity

Currently no evidence that remdesivir improves survival and other outcomes

Guideline, developed by international guideline development group

28 clinical care experts, 4 patient-partners, one ethicist

Match scientific standards with the speed required to respond to an ongoing pandemic

WHO Solidarity Trial, 3 other randomized controlled trials

N = 7000

Insufficient evidence of an important effect on: 

Mortality

Need for mechanical ventilation

Time to clinical improvement

Other patient-important outcomes

Supported continued enrollment in trials evaluating remdesivir.

A conditional recommendation

When the evidence around the benefits and risks of an intervention are less certain

In this case, there is a conditional recommendation against the use of remdesivir

This means that there isn’t enough evidence to support its use.

US pharmaceutical company Gilead

Disputes the findings

WHO's findings were yet to be subjected to peer review

Remdesivir is currently approved for use as a COVID-19 in over 50 countries

Type 1 Reaction : https://youtu.be/vYaVf6Cl4Y8

Complement System : https://youtu.be/d6qFPegEYV0

Type II hypersensitivity is mediated by IgM or IgG targeting membrane-associated antigens. A sensitization phase leads to production of antibodies that recognize substances or metabolites that accumulate in cellular membrane structures. In the effector phase, target cells become coated with antibodies, a process termed opsonization, which leads to cellular destruction by three mechanisms: (1) phagocytosis, (2) complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and (3) ADCC.

The most common cause of type II reactions are medications including penicillins, cephalosporins, hydrochlorothiazide, and methyldopa, which become associated with red blood cells or platelets leading to anemia and thrombocytopenia",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RDgBSUD5nkA/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-16 17:03:55.245805

017eWXq51MY,iBiology,UCsvqEZBO-kNmwuDBbKbfL6A,1394638925.0,"Joseph Takahashi (UT Southwestern/HHMI) Part 1B: Circadian Clocks: Clock Genes, Cells and Circuits 2","https://www.ibiology.org/genetics-and-gene-regulation/circadian-clocks/#part-2

Lecture Overview: 
Circadian rhythms are an adaptation to the 24 hr day that we experience. Takahashi begins his talk with an historic overview of how the genes controlling circadian clocks were first identified in Drosophila and the cloning tour de force that was required to identify clock genes in mice. He also describes the experiments that resulted in the realization that all cells in the body have a circadian clock, not just cells in the brain.  
In part 1B, Takahashi explains that the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the brain generates a circadian rhythm of fluctuating body temperature that, in turn, signals to peripheral tissues. Heat shock factor 1 is one of the signaling molecules responsible for communicating the temperature information and resetting peripheral clocks. 
In Part 2, Takahashi describes how crossing many mice of different genetic backgrounds allowed his lab to identify several genes that impact the output of the clock gene system through different mechanisms.
Takahashi begins the last part of his presentation with the crystal structures of BMAL and Clock, the two central activators of clock gene transcription. He goes on to describe how his lab showed that BMAL/Clock controls the DNA binding activity of transcriptional regulators of not only cycling genes, but also of basic cell functions such as RNA polymerase 2 occupancy and histone modification. 

Speaker Bio: 
Joseph Takahashi received his BA in biology from Swarthmore College, his PhD in neuroscience from the University of Oregon, and he was a post-doctoral fellow with Martin Zatz at the National Institutes of Mental Health.  He then spent 26 years at Northwestern University where he was a faculty member in the Department of Neurobiology and Physiology and in 1997 he became an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.  In 2008, Takahashi joined the University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center as the Loyd B. Sands Distinguished Chair in Neuroscience.
Using forward genetic screens in mice, Takahashi identified the first mammalian circadian gene ""Clock"" in 1997.  Since then, his lab has gone on to identify and clone numerous circadian genes in both the brain and tissues throughout the body.  Takahashi has received numerous awards and honors for his ground-breaking research including election to the National Academy of Sciences.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/017eWXq51MY/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-16 17:03:55.991354

wrP78K1objc,TEDx Talks,UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q,1541799427.0,Circadian Code to Extend Longevity | Satchin Panda | TEDxVeniceBeach,"Nurture your sleep and circadian rhythm by managing blue light, time restricted eating or intermittent fasting. Having a healthy circadian rhythm can balance hormones, brain chemicals, gut microbiome, organ function and reduces inflammation. These benefits add up to decades of healthy life. Dr. Satchin Panda’s circadian rhythm research has discovered that light and meal time have profound health impact. He found a new light sensor in our eye measures blue light to tune brain functions ranging from falling asleep to throbbing migraine pain in a sunny day. This simple discovery has triggered a new field of light therapeutics in which phones have come up with features to flip a button to “night shift” and blue filtering glasses are new sleeping pills. Dr. Panda also discovered that the number of hours between our breakfast and dinner may be as important as day’s calorie counts. 

Dr. Panda grew up in India, did his doctoral research at The Scripps Research Institute, and postdoctoral training at Novartis before starting his independent research lab at the Salk Institute, La Jolla. He is a Pew Scholar in Biomedical Research, an American Federation of Aging Research mid-career scientist.

dUVmdgrhoQ0,Hussain Biology,UCDCg5AAslixldHh5D7Nu6-g,1495453693.0,Circadian Rhythm | Pathway of Biological Clock,"A circadian rhythm is any biological process that displays an endogenous, entrainable oscillation of about 24 hours. These 24-hour rhythms are driven by a circadian clock, and they have been widely observed in plants, animals, fungi, and cyanobacteria.

The term circadian comes from the Latin circa, meaning ""around"" (or ""approximately""), and diēm, meaning ""day"". The formal study of biological temporal rhythms, such as daily, tidal, weekly, seasonal, and annual rhythms, is called chronobiology. Processes with 24-hour oscillations are more generally called diurnal rhythms; strictly speaking, they should not be called circadian rhythms unless their endogenous nature is confirmed.

Although circadian rhythms are endogenous (""built-in"", self-sustained), they are adjusted (entrained) to the local environment by external cues called zeitgebers (from German, ""time giver""), which include light, temperature and redox cycles.

Io5rT4-VDrA,BioMagica,UCDNO4DNTmejHP9aH2vcSQNg,1522334132.0,Luria Delbruck Experiment (Fluctuation Test) II DNA mutations,"The Luria–Delbrück experiment, 1943, also called the 'Fluctuation Test', asks the question: are mutations independent of natural selection? Or are they directed by the selection?

Max Delbrück and Salvador Luria showed that in bacteria, DNA mutations happen randomly. This means they happen at any time, rather than being a response to selection.

So, Darwin's theory of natural selection acting on random mutations applies to bacteria as well as to more complex organisms.

Delbrück and Luria won the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine partly for this work.
In their experiment, Luria and Delbrück grew bacteria in tubes. After a period of growth, they put equal volumes of these separate cultures onto agar containing phage (virus). If virus resistance were not due to random gene mutations, then each plate should contain roughly the same number of resistant colonies. This, however was not what Delbrück and Luria found. Instead, the number of resistant colonies on each plate varied drastically.

Luria and Delbrück proposed that these results could be explained by the occurrence of a constant rate of random mutations in each generation of bacteria growing in the initial culture tubes",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Io5rT4-VDrA/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-16 17:03:56.840673

Protein splicing is an intramolecular reaction of a particular protein in which an internal protein segment (called an intein) is removed from a precursor protein with a ligation of C-terminal and N-terminal external proteins (called exteins) on both sides. The splicing junction of the precursor protein is mainly a cysteine or a serine, which are amino acids containing a nucleophilic side chain. The protein splicing reactions which are known now do not require exogenous cofactors or energy sources such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Normally, splicing is associated only with pre-mRNA splicing.
The type of the splicing proteins is categorized into four classes: maxi-intein, mini-intein, trans-splicing intein, and alanine intein. The maxi-inteins are N- and C-terminal splicing domains containing an endonuclease domain. The mini-inteins are typical N- and C-terminal splicing domains; however, the endonuclease domain is not present. The trans-splicing inteins are split inteins which are divided into N-termini and C-termini. Alanine inteins have the splicing junction of an alanine instead of a cysteine or a serine, in both of which the protein splicing occurs.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OyItm2q2mu4/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-16 17:03:56.840673

Channel Memberships : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG5TBPANNSiKf1Dp-R5Dibg/join

Acute myocardial infarction (MI) indicates irreversible myocardial injury resulting in necrosis of a significant portion of myocardium (generally more than1 cm). The term ""acute"" denotes infarction less than 3-5 days old when the inflammatory infiltrate is primarily neutrophilic. Acute MI may be either of the nonreperfusion types, in which case the obstruction to blood flow is permanent, or of the reperfusion type, in which the obstruction or lack of blood flow is long enough in duration (generally hours) but is reversed or restored after myocardial cell death occurs.

Gross Features
Sequence:
------------------
18-24 hours - myocardial pallor.
1-3 days - pallor, moderate hyperemia (redness due to congestion with blood).
3-7 days - yellow lesion with hyperemic border.
10-21 days - maximally yellow.
6 weeks - white (fibrosis).

Microscopic Features
Sequence:
-----------------
1-3 hours - Wavy (myocardial) fibers
4-12 hours - Coagulative necrosis & loss of cross striations, contraction bands, edema, hemorrhage, PMN infiltrate.
18-24 hours - Coagulative necrosis, pyknosis of nuclei, and marginal contraction bands.
1-3 days - Loss of nuclei (karyolysis), loss of striations, abundant PMNs.
3-7 days - Macrophage and mononuclear infiltration, fibrovascular response.
10-21 days - Fibrovascular response, prominent granulation tissue.
6 weeks - Fibrosis.

Cardiac Tamponade -- causes, ECG, Diagnosis, Pathology, Clinical findings, Treatment

Cardiac tamponade is the condition where Compression exerted on the heart by the accumulation of blood or fluid in the pericardium, compromising cardiac output. Primary symptoms are shortness of breath accompanied by hypotension and tachycardia. Other findings include cyanosis, peripheral leg edema, chest pain, decreased heart sounds, fatigue, tachypnea, syncope, anuria, oliguria, pericardial friction rub, and pulsus paradoxus. Similar etiology as pericardial effusion or hemorrhage, including a wide variety of infections, autoimmune diseases, autoinflammatory disorders, tumor growth, trauma, radiation, iatrogenic causes, and cardiac or metabolic abnormalities. Rarely drug-induced.

Best Tests
-----------------
Echocardiography: assess for the presence and extent of pericardial effusion. Findings of the diastolic collapse of the right atrium and ventricle, as well as increased respiratory variation inflow across the mitral and tricuspid valves on Doppler assessment, strongly suggest pericardial tamponade.

Right-sided heart failure - Part 1  (Definition  and Pathogenesis) : Usmle step 1

The heart's pumping action moves ""used"" blood that returns to the heart through the veins through the right atrium into the right ventricle. The right ventricle then pumps the blood back out of the heart into the lungs to be replenished with oxygen.

Right-sided or right ventricular (RV) heart failure usually occurs as a result of left-sided failure. When the left ventricle fails, increased fluid pressure is, in effect, transferred back through the lungs, ultimately damaging the heart's right side. When the right side loses pumping power, blood backs up in the body's veins. This usually causes swelling or congestion in the legs, ankles and swelling within the abdomen such as the GI tract and liver (causing ascites).

What energizes business, education, health, and ideas?  What energizes you? A broad mix of thinkers and doers characterizes the TEDx experience both on the stage and in the audience. TEDxConejo is open to the general public and produced in association with the Conejo Valley Unified School District. For more information visit www.tedxconejo.com

About TEDx
In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.

The DNA in just one of your cells gets damaged tens of thousands of times per day. Because DNA provides the blueprint for the proteins your cells need to function, this damage can cause serious issues—including cancer. Fortunately, your cells have ways of fixing most of these problems, most of the time. Monica Menesini details the processes of DNA damage and repair.

---
Mammalian moms aren’t the only ones to deliver babies and feed them milk. Tsetse flies, the insects best known for transmitting sleeping sickness, do it too.

A researcher at the University of California, Davis is trying to understand in detail the unusual way in which these flies reproduce in order to find new ways to combat the disease, which has a crippling effect on a huge swath of Africa.

When it’s time to give birth, a female tsetse fly takes less than a minute to push out a squiggly yellowish larva almost as big as itself. The first time he watched a larva emerge from its mother, UC Davis medical entomologist Geoff Attardo was reminded of a clown car.

“There’s too much coming out of it to be able to fit inside,” he recalled thinking. “The fact that they can do it eight times in their lifetime is kind of amazing to me.”

Tsetse flies live four to five months and deliver those eight offspring one at a time. While the larva is growing inside them, they feed it milk. This reproductive strategy is extremely rare in the insect world, where survival usually depends on laying hundreds or thousands of eggs.

--- What is sleeping sickness?

Tsetse flies, which are only found in Africa, feed exclusively on the blood of humans and other domestic and wild animals. As they feed, they can transmit microscopic parasites called trypanosomes, which cause sleeping sickness in humans and a version of the disease known as nagana in cattle and other livestock. Sleeping sickness is also known as human African trypanosomiasis. 

--- What are the symptoms of sleeping sickness?

The disease starts with fatigue, anemia and headaches. It is treatable with medication, but if trypanosomes invade the central nervous system they can cause sleep disruptions and hallucinations and eventually make patients fall into a coma and die.

Despite looking like a head, they’re actually located at the back of the larva, which used them to breathe while growing inside its mother. The larva continues to breathe through the lobes as it develops underground.

Our Update 71 is available at https://www.medcram.com/courses/coronavirus-outbreak-symptoms-treatment

As many states in the US make arrangements to re-open their economies, Dr. Seheult discusses some recent trends in COVID-19 infections and deaths. Glutathione is a substance produced naturally by the liver- and is also found in vegetables, fruits, and meats.  Dr. Seheult discusses some interesting case reports from New York and Russia that suggest glutathione deficiency may be related to COVID-19 severity. More studies are needed to assess if supplementation of NAC and glutathione could aid in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19

Dr. Mina's research has shown that the sensitivity of these ""daily quick tests"" (the technology already exists) is high enough to detect the vast majority of infectious COVID-19 and could be utilized frequently at home. These antigen tests only require a nasal or saliva sample.

Illustrated by a Scripps Research scientist, this installment of Science, Simplified gives an overview of the entire infection process.

Science, Simplified is a new series from Scripps Research highlighting key scientific concepts in short, easy-to-understand videos. 

Video Script: 

Due to its unique features, the novel coronavirus is particularly good at infecting new cells, both in the upper respiratory tract, as well as deeper down in the lungs. Here’s a look at how the process takes place.
1. The microscopic virus enters through the nose or mouth, where it begins its infection of our airways.
2. The outer spike protein of the coronavirus latches onto specific receptors on the surface of cells in our respiratory tract. In the case of COVID-19, the virus latches on to the ACE2 receptor.
3. This binding triggers the process by which the virus fuses into human cells. The viral envelope merges with the oily membrane of our own cells, allowing the virus to release its genetic material into the inside of the healthy cell.
4. The genetic blueprint of the virus is RNA (instead of DNA), which acts as a molecular message, instructing our host cell machinery to read the template and translate it into proteins that make up new virus particles.
5. The hijacking persists, as the human host cell continues to generate more copies of the virus, assemble these copies into viable particles and traffic them to the outer edges of the cell for release.
6. Each infected cell may produce and release millions of copies of the virus, which can then go on to infect other neighboring cells, as well as neighboring people when they are expelled from the airways in droplets via coughing and sneezing.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dA70ZdYhhCg/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-16 17:04:01.520718

COVID-19 is the short name for the disease known as novel coronavirus disease 2019. Coronaviruses are a large group of similar viruses. Some are known to infect humans, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The one that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2. All coronaviruses are named for the crown-like “spikes” that cover their surface, called spike, or “S,” proteins. Inside the virus, genetic material, called RNA, is made up of genes. Genes carry the information to make more copies of the virus. The virus can infect you if it enters your mouth, nose, or lungs. Inside your body, the S protein of the virus locks to a receptor on the surface of one of your cells. This can trigger the virus to enter the cell in a couple of ways. It may cause the virus to fuse with the cell surface, then release its genes into the cell. Or, the cell may pull the virus inside by enclosing it in a sac. Once inside, the virus can fuse to the sac and release its genes. Next, the genes use a structure in your cell, called a ribosome, to make new copies of the virus. The new viruses travel to the surface of the cell. There, they can leave to infect more cells. In the meantime, viral S proteins left on the surface of the infected cell can cause it to fuse with nearby healthy cells, forming a giant cell. This may be another way for the virus to spread between cells. People may be infected with COVID-19 for two to fourteen days before symptoms appear. The three main symptoms of COVID-19 are: a fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms may include: tiredness, body aches, stuffy nose, sore throat, diarrhea and vomiting, loss of appetite, and loss of smell. Most people have a mild illness and can recover at home. Some people who have the virus may not get sick at all or may show no symptoms. But, if you have trouble breathing, or any other symptoms that are severe, call your doctor or the emergency room. They will tell you what to do. For most people who have the virus, the risk for serious illness is thought to be low. People sixty-five years and older may have a higher risk for serious illness. And, people of any age may be at high-risk if they have underlying conditions, such as: chronic lung disease or asthma; serious heart conditions; diabetes; severe obesity; chronic kidney disease, and liver disease. High-risk groups also include people with a weakened immune system, including: those on certain medications, such as corticosteroids;  people in cancer treatment; and those with HIV or AIDS.  Even if you aren’t in a high-risk group, it’s important to practice social distancing, which means keeping at least two meters, or six feet, between you and other people. This helps prevent infections and serious illness in others as well as yourself. For up-to-date information about COVID-19 and other ways to prevent its spread, visit the CDC website.

Download the study materials here-
http://shomusbiology.weebly.com/bio-materials.html
The lectin pathway is a type of cascade reaction, similar in structure to the classical complement pathway,[1] in that, after activation, it proceeds through the action of C4 and C2 to produce activated complement proteins further down the cascade. In contrast to the classical complement pathway, the lectin pathway does not recognize antibody bound to its target. The lectin pathway starts with mannose-binding lectin or ficolin binding to certain sugars.

In this pathway, mannose-binding lectin binds to mannose, glucose or other sugars with 3- and 4-OH groups placed in the equatorial plane, in terminal positions on carbohydrate or glycoprotein components of microorganisms including bacteria such as Salmonella, Listeria, and Neisseria strains. Fungal pathogens such as Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans as well as some viruses such as HIV-1 and Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are bound by MBL.

Mannan-binding lectin (MBL, also called mannose-binding protein) is a protein belonging to the collectin family that is produced by the liver and can initiate the complement cascade by binding to pathogen surfaces.
MBL forms oligomers of subunits, which are trimers (6- to 18-heades correspond to a dimer and a hexamer, respectively). Multimers of MBL form a complex with MASP1 (Mannose-binding lectin-Associated Serine Protease), MASP2 and MASP3, that are protease zymogens. The MASPs are very similar to C1r and C1s molecules of the classical complement pathway, respectively, and are thought to have a common evolutionary ancestor. When the carbohydrate-recognising heads of MBL bind to specifically arranged mannose residues on the surface of a pathogen, MASP-1 and MASP-2 are activated to cleave complement components C4 and C2 into C4a, C4b, C2a, and C2b. In addition, two smaller MBL-associated proteins (MAps) are found in complex with MBL. MBL-associated protein of 19 kDa (MAp19) and MBL-associated protein of 44 kDa (Map44). MASP-1, MASP-3 and MAp44 are alternative splice products of the MASP1 gene, while MASP-2 and MAp19 are alternative splice products of the MASP-2 gene. MAp44 has been suggested to act as a competitive inhibitor of lectin pathway activation, by displacing MASP-2 from MBL, hence preventing cleavage of C4 and C2 [2] Source of the article published in description is Wikipedia.

nqkNmCBik14,Thermo Fisher Scientific,UCfUs2fCDhx07fkszsJ0jOcA,1441142979.0,The Significance of Early Ct’s - Ask TaqMan #35,"Ask your question at https://www.thermofisher.com/ask

Are you new to qPCR? Have you ever wondered what this whole ‘Ct’ thing means?  Why is it important?  And why is early Ct’s better?

To answer these questions, we need to first understand what happens in a qPCR experiment.  qPCR stands for quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction.  In a qPCR, DNA amplification is measured in real time by the fluorescent dye signals.

Let’s take a look at our lab book. 

The increase in dye signal is in direct proportion to the number of PCR products.  By collecting this fluorescent signal - during the exponential phase of the reaction - we are able to obtain quantitative information on the starting amount of the DNA target.

Here’s how.  Let’s examine this representative qPCR amplification plot.  A threshold line is drawn through the plot in the exponential phase of the curve.  Reagents are plentiful during this phase, and thus there is an exact doubling of the target.  From this intersection, we can now drop down to the x-axis and assign a Ct value to this amplification reaction.  

Okay, so now we’ve got a Ct value, but what does it mean?  And why is smaller better?

The Ct value, or threshold cycle, is the cycle number at which the fluorescent signal of the reaction crosses the threshold.  The Ct value is inversely related to the starting amount of our target DNA.  For example, if I have two samples, one with 200 ng of cDNA and the other with 25 ng of cDNA, I will get an earlier, or smaller, Ct value with the first one.  This is because it will take fewer PCR cycles for the fluorescent signal to rise above background for the first sample.  The second sample, since it is starting from less template (only 1/8 as much!) will take more cycles to reach the same level of detectable fluorescence.  

So here’s the take home message: as the amount of DNA template decreases, the Ct value will increase.  If the Ct value gets too high, say a Ct of 35 in a 96 well plate, it can be difficult to distinguish real signal from background.  For this reason, many researchers will employ a Ct cutoff - and not use any data above that Ct value.      

Researchers who want to optimize their systems will often look to the raw Ct values to compare whether a reagent results in better performance or not.  Let’s say for example, you ran the same samples and assay with 2 different master mixes.  A mix that results in earlier Ct’s is therefore beneficial because you will not need to use as much sample for the same level of detection.  This can be especially important when dealing with limited or precious samples.  

If you’ve got more qPCR or digital PCR questions, remember, just ask Taqman.

oQqONI2k5wM,The Film Archives,UCb2EYjrzI6WpNAmPZeihhag,1374055541.0,"Corporate Takeovers: Shareholders, Stocks, Capital Structure, Consequences, Financing (1989)","In business, a takeover is the purchase of one company (the target) by another (the acquirer, or bidder). In UK, the term refers to the acquisition of a public company whose shares are listed on a stock exchange, in contrast to the acquisition of a private company.

A ""friendly takeover"" is an acquisition which is approved by the management. Before a bidder makes an offer for another company, it usually first informs the company's board of directors. In an ideal world, if the board feels that accepting the offer serves the shareholders better than rejecting it, it recommends the offer be accepted by the shareholders.

In a private company, because the shareholders and the board are usually the same people or closely connected with one another, private acquisitions are usually friendly. If the shareholders agree to sell the company, then the board is usually of the same mind or sufficiently under the orders of the equity shareholders to cooperate with the bidder. This point is not relevant to the UK concept of takeovers, which always involve the acquisition of a public company.

A ""hostile takeover"" allows a suitor to take over a target company whose management is unwilling to agree to a merger or takeover. A takeover is considered ""hostile"" if the target company's board rejects the offer, but the bidder continues to pursue it, or the bidder makes the offer directly after having announced its firm intention to make an offer. Development of the hostile tender is attributed to Louis Wolfson.

A hostile takeover can be conducted in several ways. A tender offer can be made where the acquiring company makes a public offer at a fixed price above the current market price. Tender offers in the United States are regulated by the Williams Act. An acquiring company can also engage in a proxy fight, whereby it tries to persuade enough shareholders, usually a simple majority, to replace the management with a new one which will approve the takeover. Another method involves quietly purchasing enough stock on the open market, known as a ""creeping tender offer"", to effect a change in management. In all of these ways, management resists the acquisition, but it is carried out anyway.

The main consequence of a bid being considered hostile is practical rather than legal. If the board of the target cooperates, the bidder can conduct extensive due diligence into the affairs of the target company, providing the bidder with a comprehensive analysis of the target company's finances. In contrast, a hostile bidder will only have more limited, publicly available information about the target company available, rendering the bidder vulnerable to hidden risks regarding the target company's finances. An additional problem is that takeovers often require loans provided by banks in order to service the offer, but banks are often less willing to back a hostile bidder because of the relative lack of target information which is available to them.

A ""reverse takeover"" is a type of takeover where a private company acquires a public company. This is usually done at the instigation of the larger, private company, the purpose being for the private company to effectively float itself while avoiding some of the expense and time involved in a conventional IPO. However, in the UK under AIM rules, a reverse take-over is an acquisition or acquisitions in a twelve-month period which for an AIM company would:

    exceed 100% in any of the class tests; or
    result in a fundamental change in its business, board or voting control; or
    in the case of an investing company, depart substantially from the investing strategy stated in its admission document or, where no admission document was produced on admission, depart substantially from the investing strategy stated in its pre-admission announcement or, depart substantially from the investing strategy.

An individual or organization, sometimes known as corporate raider, can purchase a large fraction of the company's stock and, in doing so, get enough votes to replace the board of directors and the CEO. With a new agreeable management team, the stock is a much more attractive investment, which would likely result in a price rise and a profit for the corporate raider and the other shareholders.

Sir Martin Sorrell advises students to look as the faster growing markets. The two market 'planets he describes are planet 'No Growth' (US and Western Europe) and planet 'Growth' which are the less 11 world economies. 
This new generation of people starting businesses are much more mobile compared to Martin Sorrell's generation in terms of willingness to pick up new things and learning languages. He says that being more flexible is much more important now than it ever was.
Advice for starting up a new business is to look for geographical growth and technological change. It's important to think about the application of data to a business and 'Horizontality', which is getting people in various parts of the organisation to work together in a more cohesive and effective way

Mutation results when changes occur in the nucleotide sequence of a DNA.
The term mutation refers to the permanent changes in the DNA sequence.
Mutations in germ cells are transmitted to the next progeny and may give rise to inherited diseases.
Mutations in somatic cells are not transmitted to the progeny but are important in the causation of cancers and some congenital malfunctions.

Mutagens and Mutagenesis
Any agent which will increase DNA damage or cell proliferation can cause increased rate of mutations also. Such substances are called mutagens. 
  X-ray, gamma-ray, UV ray, acridine orange, etc. are well known mutagens. 
The rate of mutation is proportional to the dose of irradiation. 

Causes of Mutations
Errors in replication, If a mismatch base pair is not corrected during proofreading and post replication repair system.
Error due to recombination events.
Spontaneous change in DNA, e.g. deamination of cytosine to uracil or spontaneous depurination.
Environmental factors like chemical mutagens and irradiations, e.g. UV light or ionizing radiation can alter the structure of DNA.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YT7-mnkSbLs/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-16 17:04:20.150331

A gene mutation is a permanent alteration in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene, such that the sequence differs from what is found in most humans. Mutations variety in dimension; they are able to have an impact on wherever from a single DNA building block (base pair) to a huge segment of a chromosome that involves more than one genes.
Gene mutations can be classified in two most important approaches:
Hereditary mutations are inherited from a mother or father and are present for the period of a individual’s lifestyles in practically each mobile within the body. These mutations are also referred to as germline mutations due to the fact they're present within the mum or dad’s egg or sperm cells, which might be also called germ cells. When an egg and a sperm mobilephone unite, the resulting fertilized egg telephone receives DNA from both mum and dad. If this DNA has a mutation, the youngster that grows from the fertilized egg may have the mutation in every of his or her cells.
Acquired (or somatic) mutations arise at some time during a character’s lifestyles and are present handiest in specified cells, not in each telephone within the physique. These changes can also be induced by using environmental explanations corresponding to ultraviolet radiation from the solar, or can occur if a mistake is made as DNA copies itself for the period of telephone division. Acquired mutations in somatic cells (cells rather then sperm and egg cells) can't be passed on to the next iteration.
Genetic changes that are described as de novo (new) mutations can be either hereditary or somatic. In some cases, the mutation occurs in a man or woman’s egg or sperm mobile but isn't present in any of the character’s other cells. In other instances, the mutation happens in the fertilized egg quickly after the egg and sperm cells unite. (it's commonly unimaginable to tell exactly when a de novo mutation happened.) because the fertilized egg divides, each and every resulting phone within the developing embryo could have the mutation. De novo mutations could provide an explanation for genetic issues wherein an affected child has a mutation in each mobilephone in the physique however the mum and dad don't, and there is not any loved ones historical past of the sickness.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S_3C7R6UbAI/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-16 17:04:20.150331

Lyrics:
There are 8 planets in our Solar System 
And we revolve around the sun
Join us to learn about the different planets
Now sing along and have some fun

My name is Mercury
I’m the 2nd Hottest Planet
But the closest one to the sun
A year on my surface is 88 Days
I’m the smallest but I’m lots of fun

My name is Venus
I’m The Hottest Planet 
But the 2nd Planet from the sun
I’m the Brightest planet in our solar system
And I’m too hot for anyone

My name is Earth
I’m the planet you live on 
The 3rd Planet from the sun
I’m the Only Planet with Organic Life
So take care of me because we’re all one

There are 8 planets in our Solar System 
And we revolve around the sun
Join us to learn about the different planets
Now sing along and have some fun

My name is Mars
I am red in color 
And the 4th Planet from the sun
I have the highest mountain in our solar system
A volcano named Olympus Mons

My name is Jupiter 
I am covered in clouds
And I’m the 5th Planet from the sun
My giant red spot is a raging storm 
As for size, I’m the biggest one

My name is Saturn 
I am brown in color
I’m the 6th Planet from the sun 
My outer rings are extremely thin
They’re made of dust and icy chunks 

There are 8 planets in our Solar System 
And we revolve around the sun
Join us to learn about the different planets
Now sing along and have some fun

My names Uranus 
I am blue in color 
I’m the 7th Planet from the sun
I orbit the sun once in 84 Earth Years
And was Discovered in 1781

My name is Neptune 
also, blue in color 
I’m the 8th Planet from the sun
I’m the last gas giant in our Solar System
And I’m also The Coldest one

There are 8 planets in our Solar System 
And we revolve around the sun
Join us to learn about the different planets
Now sing along and have some fun",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/awM6BCpxRaE/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-16 17:04:21.671331

LYRICS
When the day has finally ended and the kids are fast asleep
And the house is good and quiet, without one single peep
And with Santa’s sleigh now nearing
And my last report all filed
My Christmas Eve is gearing up
To be scout elf-eriffic’ly-wonder-‘fly wild

 Oh no! Is that a little kid out of bed?

Launch a sturdy candy cable
Quickly leap onto the table
Shush the dog and calm the kitty as the mayhem mounts
Step on broken decorations
Lower lofty expectations
Lure the kid back to his pillow, every second counts

Get The Elf Pets at the ready
Hold on and tight and hold on steady
Have to hurry, have to not lose heart
Don’t give up and don’t get tired
Stay awake and stay inspired
But my perfect plan is falling all apart

It's the night before Christmas
But it’s not how this should go
The night before Christmas
I'm wondering will Santa even show?

Then what to my wond’ring elf eyes does appear
A red and gold sleigh with a host of reindeer!
Santa!
To my happy heart a-pounding
Down the chimney he comes bounding
Eyes a-twinkle, snaps his fingers and it’s quite a sight
With his magic overflowing
Christmas spirit’s only growing
‘Cause Santa knows the way to make it all alright

The night before Christmas
The best that we’ve had yet
The night before Christmas
This clearly is a year i won’t forget

But just before leaving we stop and take in
What a magical season and night this has been
 
Then we take off and fly
Past the stars shining bright
Merry Christmas to all
And to all a good night!

xNYq6PwMV0U,TEDx Talks,UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q,1495751935.0,Bringing Cell Culture into the 21st Century | Margaret Magdesian | TEDxMontreal,"Neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's can cause irreversible damage to the nervous system, brain and spinal cord. As it is not yet possible to regenerate neurons over long distances and accurately reconnect them, this damage can lead to permanent disabilities for many. Margaret and her collaborators have found a new way to rapidly and accurately reconnect neurons by developing a new technique to significantly increase the efficiency of tissue culture tests. She has shown that using more efficient cell culture models, and thus replacing the existing 100-year-old process of cell multiplication, researchers can achieve significant and reproducible results faster. 

Dr Margaret Magdesian is a neuroscientist studying the mechanism of neuronal degeneration and repair with over 15 years of experience in biopharmaceutical research. Tired of the slow, expensive and inefficient process of drug development, she developed in collaboration with researchers from the Montreal Neurological Institute and McGill University, a new technique to increase the efficiency of cellular assays. This new technique enabled the reconnection of neurons 60 times faster than previously reported. In the future, similar techniques may even allow surgeons to reestablish connections after injury. 

In 2015, she launched a company called ANANDA Devices (Advanced Nano Design Applications) to extend the use of these devices and techniques to other fields in medicine. Her hope is to stimulate other scientists to achieve reproducible and impactful results faster. Dr Magdesian’s innovation has the potential to dramatically accelerate the drug development cycle of new therapies for people that need it.

8kbAQq_Pp8g,Hussain Biology,UCDCg5AAslixldHh5D7Nu6-g,1502092744.0,Mechanism of Apoptosis | Intrinsic Pathway,"The mitochondria are essential to multicellular life. Without them, a cell ceases to respire aerobically and quickly dies. This fact forms the basis for some apoptotic pathways. Apoptotic proteins that target mitochondria affect them in different ways. They may cause mitochondrial swelling through the formation of membrane pores, or they may increase the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and cause apoptotic effectors to leak out.[19][24] They are very closely related to intrinsic pathway, and tumors arise more frequently through intrinsic pathway than the extrinsic pathway because of sensitivity.[25] There is also a growing body of evidence indicating that nitric oxide is able to induce apoptosis by helping to dissipate the membrane potential of mitochondria and therefore make it more permeable.[26] Nitric oxide has been implicated in initiating and inhibiting apoptosis through its possible action as a signal molecule of subsequent pathways that activate apoptosis.[27][citation needed]

Mitochondrial proteins known as SMACs (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases) are released into the cell's cytosol following the increase in permeability of the mitochondria membranes. SMAC binds to proteins that inhibit apoptosis (IAPs) thereby deactivating them, and preventing the IAPs from arresting the process and therefore allowing apoptosis to proceed. IAP also normally suppresses the activity of a group of cysteine proteases called caspases,[28] which carry out the degradation of the cell. Therefore, the actual degradation enzymes can be seen to be indirectly regulated by mitochondrial permeability.

Cytochrome c is also released from mitochondria due to formation of a channel, the mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel (MAC), in the outer mitochondrial membrane,[29] and serves a regulatory function as it precedes morphological change associated with apoptosis.[19] Once cytochrome c is released it binds with Apoptotic protease activating factor – 1 (Apaf-1) and ATP, which then bind to pro-caspase-9 to create a protein complex known as an apoptosome. The apoptosome cleaves the pro-caspase to its active form of caspase-9, which in turn activates the effector caspase-3.

MAC (not to be confused with the Membrane Attack Complex formed by complement activation, also commonly denoted as MAC), also called ""Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization Pore"" is regulated by various proteins, such as those encoded by the mammalian Bcl-2 family of anti-apoptopic genes, the homologs of the ced-9 gene found in C. elegans.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8kbAQq_Pp8g/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-16 17:04:22.252933

Inflammation : Definition Local response of living tissue To any injurious agent
Protective response needed for survival!Can Cause tissue damage by itself!

Historical Aspects

The word inflammation from the Latin inflammare (to set on fire).
Celsus , Roman Writer 1st century AD   listed the four signs of inflammation.
He said “rubor et tumor cum calore et dolore” which meant “redness and swelling with heat and pain”
The 5th Sign “Functio leasa”  Loss of function Was added by Rudolf Virchow In 19th Century
John Hunter, Scottish surgeon:1793: inflammation is not a disease but just  a response!
Elie Metchinkoff: 1880s; A Russian zoologist,  Discovered the process of Phagocytosis

The 5 “R”sSteps of inflammatory response

RECOGNITION   of the injurious agent
RECRUITMENT of inflammatory cells ( leukocytes)
REMOVAL of the injurious agent
REGULATION ( control) of the inflammatory response
RESOLUTION/REPAIR

ACUTE INFLAMMATION
Vascular Changes
 There will be increase in the blood flow 
To bring cells and proteins to the site of injury
By vasodilatation & increased vascular permeability

Cellular events
 Recruitment of leukocytes 
Activation of leukocytes leading to  the process of destruction of invaders and production of mediators.
By Phagocytosis

How these stimuli are recognized by the host?
The antigen presenting cells/epithelial cells  have RECEPTORS  that sense these stimuli

Toll like receptors 
Microbial sensors
Present in plasma membrane & endosomes.
Recognize products of bacteria, virus and other pathogens ( almost all!!)
Results in production of mediators of inflammation

Inflammasome
Multiprotein cytoplasmic complex
Recognize products of dead cells
Activation of Caspase-1
Activation of IL-1 which is the mediator of leukocyte recruitment.
 These leukocytes phagocytose & destroy  dead cells.

Increased Vascular Permeability

Hallmark of Acute inflammation
There is escape of fluid, blood cells and proteins from the blood vessels into the interstitial tissue
Mechanisms of increased vascular permeability
Contraction of endothelial cells
Direct damage to endothelium/Endothelial injury
Endothelial injury due to leukocytes

Category: WALS - Wednesday Afternoon Lectures 

Runtime: 00:57:53  

Description: NIH Director’s Wednesday Afternoon Lecture Series 

 Historically, mitochondria have been primarily viewed as biosynthetic and bioenergetic organelles that generate metabolites for the production of macromolecules and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), respectively. The work of the Chandel laboratory has elucidated that mitochondria have a third distinct role whereby they release reactive oxygen species (ROS) and metabolites to regulate transcription factors and epigenetics. For his lecture, Dr. Chandel will present his lab’s ongoing efforts to understand how mitochondria, in addition to producing ATP, regulate cancer and immunity.

Those suffering from inheritable genetic conditions face an especially difficult decision in terms of whether or not to conceive a child. For instance, a mother with mutated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) faces an increased possibility that her child will develop an incurable disease with devastating symptoms such as seizures, developmental delay, or organ failure.

University of Newcastle professor Mary Herbert provides parents with a new solution that helps to ensure that the mutations in a mother’s affected mtDNA isn’t passed on to her child. Watch Mary's 2017 TEDMED Talk to see how she is pushing the limits of our understanding of reproduction and looking toward a future where certain mitochondrial diseases can be eliminated from a family for generations to come.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pc7MyUs_ORQ/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-16 17:04:23.351368
eAVhgHzegrI,iBiology,UCsvqEZBO-kNmwuDBbKbfL6A,1555455092.0,"Gia Voeltz (CU, HHMI) 2: Using BioID to Identify Membrane Contact Site Factors","https://www.ibiology.org/cell-biology/membrane-contact-sites

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a dynamic network of tubules that reaches throughout a cell. It interacts with other organelles at membrane contact sites. As Dr. Gia Voeltz explains, these sites are critical for Ca2+ regulation, lipid transport and defining sites of division for endosomes and other organelles. 

Many of us are used to seeing cartoons of cells with organelles shown as static, isolated structures.  The endoplasmic reticulum is often shown looking like a stack of pancakes pushed up against the nuclear envelope.  In her first talk, Dr. Gia Voeltz explains that recent advances in light microscopy have given us a very different view of organelles and their interactions. The ER is, in fact, an expansive, and highly dynamic, network of tubules that spreads throughout the cell.  It interacts with other organelles such as the plasma membrane, endosomes, and mitochondria at points called membrane contact sites.  Using beautiful fluorescent images and movies, Voeltz shows us that these ER membrane contact sites are important for many functions such as trafficking lipids and Ca2+ and determining where mitochondria divide and endosomes undergo fission. These exciting findings define a new cellular function for the ER. 

In her second lecture, Voeltz explains how her lab used a BioID strategy to identify some of the proteins found at membrane contact sites between the ER and endosomes; a difficult task given the transient nature of contact sites.  They were able to identify a number of proteins responsible for marking the timing and location of endosome fission and for recruiting the ER to the bud.  Depleting these proteins blocked cargo sorting to the Golgi. Voeltz’ lab is now working to determine how much of this machinery is conserved in processes such as the mitochondrial division.

Speaker Biography:
Dr. Gia Voeltz discovered her love for research as an undergraduate student at the University of California Santa Cruz.  After graduation, she moved east to Yale University where she was a graduate student with Joan Steitz and studied RNA processing in Xenopus extracts. As a post-doctoral fellow in Tom Rapoport’s lab at Harvard, Voeltz tackled the question of how organelles, and in particular the endoplasmic reticulum, are shaped.  

Voeltz started her own lab at the University of Colorado, Boulder in 2006.  She became an HHMI Faculty Scholar in 2016 and an HHMI Investigator in 2018. Her lab investigates how the ER interacts with other organelles such as the mitochondria and endosomes via membrane contact sites and how these contact sites may regulate organelle division and function.

John Schell tells the story of a little girl that died over a decade ago from an unknown metabolic disease. Confounded, her doctors published her case in a scientific paper hoping that the mystery would eventually be solved. Schell came upon this paper serendipitously soon after making a big discovery: He and his colleagues, using yeast genetics, found a new gene involved in the cellular breakdown of nutrients, the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). The MPC is responsible for transporting pyruvate (a nutrient) from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria, so that it can be broken down to release energy. Schell predicted that a defective MPC was the cause of the little girl's disease, so he asked the doctors for a sample of her skin cells to sequence her MPC gene. He discovered that she indeed had a mutation in her MPC gene. Further analysis showed that the mutation was likely damaging to the protein, supporting his prediction. Looking at other patients with other metabolic-related diseases, Schell also discovered that MPC function is altered in certain cancers, like colon cancer. Increasing the expression of MPC in mice slowed tumor growth over time until the tumors stopped growing altogether, suggesting a potentially new mechanism for cancer treatment.

Speaker Biography: 
John Schell is an MD/PhD candidate in Jared Rutter’s lab at the University of Utah. Schell’s research has focused on how cells get energy for growth and the role mitochondria play in this process. He helped discover the identity of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, an important gene involved in cellular metabolism that was long overlooked. As a result of this discovery, he is asking how this process might be altered in cancer and other diseases. Whenever possible, Schell seeks out new opportunities in teaching and mentoring, especially with high school and college level students. In the summer of 2015, he attended the Lindau Nobel Laureate meeting in Germany and the IUBMB-SBBq Young Scientist Program in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Both were exceptional opportunities to talk intensively and be exposed to new areas of research being carried out by passionate young scientists. As part of living in the beautiful state of Utah, Schell takes any opportunity he can to get outside and enjoy the outdoors, which includes road biking. He also really enjoys playing with his dog, Gideon, who makes a cameo appearance in Schell’s iBiology talk.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zskdEK5qSIc/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-16 17:04:23.351368

Hypersensitivity refers to abnormal reactions of the immune system against certain antigens. It includes exaggerated reactions to otherwise harmless environmental antigens, commonly known as allergies; and inappropriate reactions against the body’s own antigens, or autoimmune diseases. 
Reactions can range from a mild rash, to damaged organs, to fatal anaphylactic shock.
There are 2 principal groups of factors contributing to hypersensitivity: 
- Imbalance between effectors and regulators of immune response: in some people, mechanisms that normally moderate the immune system are compromised, causing it to overreact to harmless, non-infectious antigens.
- Self-reactivity of immune cells: during their development in the thymus and bone marrow, T-cells and B-cells learn to not react to the body’s own antigens; self-reactive cells are normally eliminated; but in some people, some of these cells escape and may attack their own tissues once activated. 
Hypersensitivity reactions only occur in pre-sensitized individuals. Patients must have had a previous contact with the antigen, which produced no symptoms, but during which the body had started making antibodies or activated immune cells that may cause symptoms in subsequent exposures to the same antigen.
Hypersensitivity is classified into 4 types based on mechanisms of action:
In type I hypersensitivity, a previous exposure to the antigen results in production of a class of antibodies called IgE. IgE molecules bind to their receptors on the surface of mast cells and basophils. Upon re-exposure to the same antigen, or sometimes a similar antigen, the antigen binds to adjacent IgE molecules, bringing their receptors together, triggering a signaling cascade that induces the release of histamine and other inflammatory chemicals. These chemicals cause dilation of blood vessels, smooth muscle spasms, and are responsible for symptoms such as edema, rash, difficulty breathing due to bronchospasm, abdominal cramping, vomiting and diarrhea. The reactions are immediate, within minutes of contact with the antigen, and can range from mild to severe. Severe reactions may lead to anaphylactic shock, a life-threatening condition in which blood pressure drops and airways narrow to a dangerous level. Most allergies are type I hypersensitivity reactions. 
In type II hypersensitivity, previously formed IgG or IgM antibodies bind to antigens on the surface of a particular cell type. Antibody binding marks the cells for destruction, either by the complement system or phagocytosis. The antibodies may also interfere with normal functions of the cells without killing them. Type II is at the basis of many autoimmune diseases, where the body produces antibodies to destroy its own cells. Another example is hemolytic disease of the newborn, where maternal antibodies bind to D-antigen on the surface of fetal red blood cells and destroy them.
Type III hypersensitivity reactions are also mediated by IgM or IgG, but in this case, the antibodies bind to free-floating antigens, forming antibody-antigen complexes. The complement system is activated and inflammation results, causing damage to the affected tissue. A typical example is serum sickness, induced by a large amount of antigens in the blood. Immune complexes are deposited in the walls of blood vessels, triggering their inflammation, or vasculitis. 
Type IV hypersensitivity is a delayed reaction, mediated by T-cells. Pre-sensitized T-cells are produced during a previous contact with the antigen. Upon re-exposure to the same antigen, T-helper cells release inflammatory cytokines, while T-killers induce cytotoxic reactions.  Typical examples are allergic reactions to substances that come into direct contact with the skin, known as contact dermatitis. Type IV is also the basis of the tuberculosis skin test.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jXTW4F-8jd4/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-16 17:04:25.199823

hcgY545LXLc,Vector Laboratories Inc,UCf7cIXth_m_0DQdyTACaOSg,1323112252.0,Detection with VECTASTAIN ELITE ABC Kit from Vector Laboratories,"With more than 60,000 citations to its credit, the VECTASTAIN® ABC kit from Vector Laboratories remains widely popular. Based on the versatile biotin/avidin interaction, the system is modular, and along with our selection of secondary antibodies, can accommodate a wide array of primary antibody and tissue species. Our ABC kits are economical and continue to be a staple product in any immunohistochemistry laboratory.

The VECTASTAIN® ABC systems are extremely sensitive due to the form and number of active enzyme molecules associated with the preformed Avidin/Biotinylated enzyme Complex. This complex takes advantage of two important properties of avidin: 1) an extraordinarily high affinity for biotin (over one million times higher than antibody for most antigens), and 2) four biotin-binding sites. These properties allow macromolecular complexes (ABC's) to be formed by mixing Avidin DH (Reagent A) with its paired biotinylated enzyme (Reagent B) prior to use. The ABC, once formed, remains stable for many hours after formation and can be used for several days after preparation.

BftwKVEuza4,Vector Laboratories Inc,UCf7cIXth_m_0DQdyTACaOSg,1323103367.0,Nucleic acid labeling with PHOTOPROBE Biotin Kit from Vector Laboratories,"PHOTOPROBE® Nucleic Acid Labeling System from Vector Laboratories is the method of choice for simple and rapid incorporation of biotin at multiple sites along the entire length of the nucleic acid. The nucleic acid labeling reaction does not destroy the original nucleic acid nor creates its copy. The integrity of the original sample is preserved. Single or double-stranded DNA, circular DNA, RNA, or PNA (peptide nucleic acid) can be labeled with the same reagents.

DNA/RNA labeling is based on aryl azide chemistry in which the reagent, when exposed to heat or light, becomes activated and incorporates into the nucleic acid without base specificity. The nucleic acid labeling reaction can be carried out using a mercury vapor bulb (sun lamp), a UV lamp which produces light in the 350 nm to 370 nm range, a halogen lamp, a heating block, or a thermal cycler providing the investigator with great flexibility in experimental design.

A distinct advantage of the simple setup in each of these labeling options is the ease and economy of scaling up.

vpDa9iTX6YM,Prostate Cancer Research Institute,UCPYrfTJMCTfhBNZxb31Z1tg,1552704030.0,Hormone Therapy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer | Prostate Cancer Staging Guide,"PCRI’s Executive Director, Mark Scholz, MD, discusses the use of hormone therapy for men with Azure (High-Risk) prostate cancer. He covers why it is necessary for men with high-risk disease and talks about the three categories of hormone therapy.

0:28 Men with Azure are generally given hormone therapy because there is a higher risk of spread outside the prostate. Hormone therapy is a systemic treatment that acts on the entire body, not just the prostate. It is effective, and its side effects are reversible. Compared to chemotherapy, another systemic treatment, it is more effective and has far fewer side effects. 

1:23 The three categories of hormone therapy. Hormone therapy, also known as testosterone inactivating pharmaceuticals (TIP) comes in three different strengths. The first and least potent category of hormone therapy is the “anti-androgens.” Common examples of these drugs are Casodex and Nilutamide. The second category and the most commonly used type of hormone therapy are the “LHRH Agonists” drugs such as Lupron, Eligard, and Trelstar. The last category is the second generation hormonal agents that operate differently than the previous categories. Examples of these are Erleada, Xtandi, and Zytiga. You don’t want more hormone therapy than what is necessary because of added side effects. 

2:43 Hormone therapy for the different subtypes of Azure. Each subtype of azure requires different amounts of hormone therapy. High-risk prostate cancer should be treated with a combination of radiation, seed implants, and hormone therapy, but the amount of hormone therapy can differ depending on the subtype. Low-Azure only requires 4-6 months of Lupron and Casodex. Basic-Azure needs between 18-24 months for optimal cure rates. And High azure needs 18-24 months possibly with the addition of a second generation TIP such as Erleada, Xtandi, or Zytiga.

4:12 Summary. The amount of hormone therapy depends on the subtype of prostate cancer. Many studies have shown that Low-Azure only requires a short course of hormone therapy and High-Azure can benefit from adding second generation hormone therapy.
